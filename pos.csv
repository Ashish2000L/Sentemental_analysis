1,wear a cloth face cover if you are around other people  sharing a room or vehicle and before you enter a health care providers office
1,if your symptoms become severe call to get medical attention immediately warning signs include
1,trouble breathing
1,persistent pain or pressure in the chest
1,new confusion or inability to arouse
1,bluish lips or face
1,there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19
1,the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus
1,the virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person
1,between people who are in close contact with one another within about 6 feet
1,through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs sneezes or talks
1,these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs
1,some recent studies have suggested that covid-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms
1,wash your hands often
1,some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus
1,do not gather in groups
1,stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings
1,keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick
1,cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others

1,if surfaces are dirty clean them use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection
1,then use a household disinfectant most common epa-registered household disinfectantsexternal icon will work
1,clean and disinfect
1,cover coughs and sneezes
1,it’s best to order food online
1,delivery services dramatically reduce your contact with other people
1,pay online
1, your primary concern while shopping should be the risk of contracting the virus from other people not from food or surfaces in the store while there’s a chance the virus could be transmitted on a surface
1,try to maintain a distance of at least six feet from other people
1,take responsibility
1,you see a crowded aisle skip it or wait for people to leave
1,be patient
1,disinfact surface areas
1,hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol is best

1, coronavirus is a large family of viruses that includes many different diseases sars-cov-2 does share similarities with other coronaviruses four of which can cause the common cold all five viruses have spiky projections on their surfaces and utilize so-called spike proteins to infect host cells however the four cold coronaviruses named 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 all utilize humans as their primary hosts sars-cov-2 shares about 90% of its genetic material with coronaviruses that infect bats which suggests that the virus originated in bats and later hopped to humans
1,there are currently no drugs licensed for the treatment or prevention of covid-19
1,while several drug trials are ongoing there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent covid-19
1,the misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death
1,hot peppers in your food though very tasty cannot prevent or cure covid-19
1,the best way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is to keep at least 1 metre away from others and to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly it is also beneficial for your general health to maintain a balanced diet stay well hydrated exercise regularly and sleep well
1,do not under any circumstance spray or introduce bleach or any other disinfectant into your body these substances can be poisonous if ingested and cause irritation and damage to your skin and eyes
1,bleach and disinfectant should be used carefully to disinfect surfaces only remember to keep chlorine bleach and other disinfectants out of reach of children
1,methanol ethanol and bleach are poisons drinking them can lead to disability and death methanol ethanol and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces  however you should never drink them they will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs
1,to protect yourself against covid-19 disinfect objects and surfaces especially the ones you touch regularly you can use diluted bleach or alcohol for that make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose
1,countries with hot weather have reported cases of covid-19 to protect yourself make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose
1,if you catch the disease make sure you treat your symptoms if you have cough fever and difficulty breathing seek medical care early but call your health facility by telephone first most patients recover thanks to supportive care
1,the most common symptoms of covid-19 are dry cough tiredness and fever
1,some people may develop more severe forms of the disease such as pneumonia
1,frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems
1,the best way to protect yourself against covid-19 is by maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre from others and frequently cleaning your hands
1,by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes mouth and nose
1,taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful as it can burn you
1,the best way to protect yourself against corona virus is by frequently cleaning your hands
1,by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes mouth and nose
1,coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose
1,to protect yourself clean your hands frequently with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water also avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing
1,hand dryers are not effective in killing the corona virus
1,you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water once your hands are cleaned you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer
1,uv radiation can cause skin irritation and damage your eyes
1,do not try uv rays on your body at home it may severly harm you
1,cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing your hands with soap and water are the most effective ways to remove the virus
1,thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever ie have a higher than normal body temperature because of infection with the new coronavirus
1,it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever
1,vaccines against pneumonia such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b hib vaccine do not provide protection against the new coronavirus
1,the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against corona virus and who is supporting their efforts
1,although these vaccines are not effective against corona virus vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health
1,there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus
1,there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold however regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections
1,garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties however there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus
1,people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus
1,older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma diabetes heart disease appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus
1,good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene
1,antibiotics do not work against viruses only bacteria
1,antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment from corona virus or covid-19
1,anyone can get coronavirus
1,the organization also says that uv lamps shouldnt be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body because the radiation can irritate skin
1,anyone of any age can get the new coronavirus though older people and those with pre existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to serious infections
1,a novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness like the common cold
1,covid-19 is caused by a coronavirus called sars-cov-2 coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals including camels cattle cats and bats  rarely animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people this occurred with mers-cov and sars-cov and now with the virus that causes covid-19 the sars-cov-2 virus is a betacoronavirus like mers-cov and sars-cov all three of these viruses have their origins in bats the sequences from us patients are similar to the one that china initially posted suggesting a likely single recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir however the exact source of this virus is unknown
1,the virus that causes covid-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another within about 6 feet
1,covid-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community “community spread” in many affected geographic areas community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area including some who are not sure how or where they became infected
1,the virus that causes covid-19 is spreading from person-to-person people are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic the sickest that is why cdc recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home depending on how sick they are until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others more recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons
1,quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness symptoms from others who have not been exposed in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure for covid-19 the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days someone who has been released from covid-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period
1,coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets currently there is no evidence to support transmission of covid-19 associated with food before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing and wash your hands after blowing your nose coughing or sneezing or going to the bathroom
1,it may be possible that a person can get covid-19 by touching a surface or object like a packaging container that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth nose or possibly their eyes but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads
1,in general because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging
1,community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area including some who are not sure how or where they became infected
1,generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments however we don’t have direct data for this virus nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point the necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface the environment etc
1,at this time cdc has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks the main way that covid-19 spreads is from person to person
1,cough
1,shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
1,or at least two of these symptoms fever chills repeated shaking with chills muscle pain headache sore throatnew loss of taste or smell
1,most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested
1,if you have symptoms of covid-19 and want to get tested call your healthcare provider first
1,you can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing
1,if you test negative for covid-19 by a viral test you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected however that does not mean you will not get sick the test result only means that you did not have covid-19 at the time of testing
1,cleaning with soap and water removes germs dirt and impurities from surfaces it lowers the risk of spreading infection disinfecting kills germs on surfaces by killing germs on a surface after cleaning it can further lower the risk of spreading infection
1,routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment surfaces frequently touched by multiple people such as door handles bathroom surfaces and handrails should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use more frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use for example certain surfaces and objects in public spaces such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads should be cleaned and disinfected before each use cleaning removes dirt and impurities including germs from surfaces cleaning alone does not kill germs but it reduces the number of germs on a surface
1,cleaning does not kill germs but by removing them it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection if a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have covid-19 the surface should be cleaned and disinfected disinfecting kills germs on surfaces
1,outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of covid-19 to the public you should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas if practical high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal such as grab bars and railings should be cleaned routinely cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces eg play structures benches tables or groundcovers eg mulch sand is not recommended
1,pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick like canine and feline coronaviruses these other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current covid-19 outbreak
1,avoid contact with your pet if your are infected with coronavirus  including petting snuggling being kissed or licked sharing food or bedding
1,close contact is defined as being within approximately 6 feet 2 meters of a covid-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for living with visiting or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a covid-19 case
1,keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers out of children’s reach teach them how to apply the sanitizer and monitor its use
1,apply a coin-sized amount on your hands there is no need to use a large amount of the product
1,avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose immediately after using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer as it can cause irritation
1,hand sanitizers recommended to protect against covid-19 are alcohol-based and therefore can be flammable do not use before handling fire or cooking
1,under no circumstance drink or let children swallow an alcohol-based hand sanitizer it can be poisonous
1,remember that washing your hands with soap and water is also effective against covid-19
1,regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water
1,washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands
1,maintain at least 1 metre 3 feet distance between yourself and others why? when someone coughs sneezes or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus
1,avoid going to crowded places
1,maintain physical distance of 6 feet
1,avoid touching eyes nose and mouth why? hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses
1,once contaminated hands can transfer the virus to your eyes nose or mouth from there the virus can enter your body and infect you
1,make sure you and the people around you follow good respiratory hygiene
1,this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze
1,then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands
1,stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough headache mild fever until you recover have someone bring you supplies if you need to leave your house wear a mask to avoid infecting others why? avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible covid-19 and other viruses
1,if you have a fever cough and difficulty breathing seek medical attention but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority
1,applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause harm especially if it enters the eyes or mouth although people can use these chemicals to disinfect surfaces they should not use them on the skin
1,chlorine and alcohol products cannot kill viruses within the body
1,sars-cov-2 like other coronaviruses can infect people of any age however older adults and individuals with preexisting health conditions such as diabetes or asthma are more likely to become severely ill
1,all age groups can contract sars-cov-2
1,sars-cov-2 causes an illness that does have flu-like symptoms such as aches a fever and a cough similarly both covid-19 and the flu can be mild severe or in rare cases fatal both can also lead to pneumonia
1,mild symptoms may include a fever a cough a sore throat tiredness and shortness of breath
1,hand dryers do not kill coronavirus the best way to protect oneself and others from the virus is to wash the hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub
1,antibiotics only kill bacteria they do not kill viruses
1,thermal scanners can detect whether or not someone has a fever however other conditions such as seasonal flu can also produce a fever
1,some research suggests that garlic might slow the growth of some species of bacteria
1,some viruses such as cold and flu viruses do spread more easily in the colder months but that does not mean that they stop entirely when conditions become milder
1,alcohol can disinfect the skin
1,consuming any alcohol poses health risks but consuming high-strength ethyl alcohol ethanol particularly if it has been adulterated with methanol can result in severe health consequences including death
1,consuming or injecting disinfectant or bleach will not remove viruses from the body
1,avoiding close contact with people who appear to be sick
1,trying not to touch the eyes nose or mouth
1,staying at home if sick
1,sneezing into a tissue then throwing it in the trash or sneezing into the crook of the elbow
1,using standard cleaning sprays and wipes to disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces
1,washing the hands with soap regularly for at least 20 seconds
1,wearing a cloth face covering in stores pharmacies and other public settings
1,it is important every individual protects him or herself by taking the necessary precautionary measures
1,corona is dangerous
1,covid-19 is dangerous
1,coronavirus is dangerous
1,stay safe stay at home
1,there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases the normal human body temperature remains around 365â°c to 37â°c regardless of the external temperature or weather the most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water
1,most of the people who catch covid-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies if you catch the disease make sure you treat your symptoms if you have cough fever and difficulty breathing seek medical care early â€ but call your health facility by telephone first most patients recover thanks to supportive care
1,you can catch covid-19 no matter how sunny or hot the weather is countries with hot weather have reported cases of covid-19 to protect yourself make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose
1,do not under any circumstance spray or introduce bleach or any other disinfectant into your body these substances can be poisonous if ingested and cause irritation and damage to your skin and eyesbleach and disinfectant should be used carefully to disinfect surfaces only remember to keep chlorine bleach and other disinfectants out of reach of children
1,to date there is no evidence or information to suggest that the covid-19 virus transmitted through houseflies the virus that cause covid-19 spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs sneezes or speaks you can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes nose or mouth before washing your hands to protect yourself keep at least 1-metre distance from others and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces clean your hands thoroughly and often and avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose
1,hot peppers in your food though very tasty cannot prevent or cure covid-19 the best way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is to keep at least 1 metre away from others and to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly it is also beneficial for your general health to maintain a balanced diet stay well hydrated exercise regularly and sleep well
1,while several drug trials are ongoing there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent covid-19 the misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death who is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat covid-19
1,thermal scanners are only helpful in  detecting people who have developed fever due to covid-19 but not actually covid-19 the systems can sense elevated skin temperatures they arenâ€™t precise enough to tell whether someone has a fever or something else
1,you cannot expect fever and symptom screening to be any kind of foolproof measure of having corona virus
