1,COVID-19 continues to change daily life in the United States as SARS-CoV-2 the virus responsible for spreading the disease sweeps across the country.
1,The U.S. declared a national emergency in mid-March and Americans have been adjusting to strict guidelines and mandates instructing them to stay home wear face masks when they do go out and stay 6 feet away from other people.
1,In early March the World Health Organization WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemica disease outbreak occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population.
1,According to the WHO there are more than 3.4 million confirmed cases of people with COVID-19  and almost 240000 people have died from the diseasea death toll that has far surpassed that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS epidemic that occurred in 2002 and 2003.
1,While some news sources report different numbers the WHO provides official counts of confirmed cases once a day.
1,In the U.S. the numbers are multiplying as different parts of the country experience varied levels of COVID-19 activity.
1,All 50 states have reported community spread meaning the source of infection is unknown and there have been large clusters in certain areas of the country.
1,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC currently provides a rough picture of the outbreak in the U.S. here currently putting the total confirmed and probable cases at more than 1.1 million and estimating more than 67000 deaths.
1,If there are any discrepancies data provided by state public health departments should be considered the most up to date according to the agency.
1,SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that scientists havent seen before.
1,Like other viruses it is believed to have started in animals and spread to humans.
1,Animal-to-person spread was suspected after the initial outbreak in December among people who had a link to a large seafood and live animal market in Wuhan China.
1,Scientists and public health officials are working as quickly as possible to find answers to key questions about the severity of the disease and its transmission.
1,They are investigating treatments and a potential vaccine for the disease.
1,Below is a list of five things you should know about the coronavirus outbreak.
1,What we know about COVID-19 is changing rapidly. What we do know about coronaviruses is that they cause respiratory tract illnesses that range from the common cold to such potentially deadly illnesses as SARS which killed almost 800 people.
1,COVID-19 is the first pandemic known to be caused by the emergence of a new coronavirusnovel influenza viruses caused four pandemics in the last century which is why the response to the new disease is being adapted from existing guidance developed in anticipation of an influenza pandemic.
1,According to the CDC reported COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from mild with no reported symptoms in some cases to severe including illness resulting in death.
1,People ages 65 and older those living in a nursing home or long-term care facility and people of all ages with underlying health conditions seem to be at higher risk of developing serious illness.
1,But doctors are still working to develop a complete clinical picture of COVID-19 as evidenced by a CDC report noting that 20% of those who have been hospitalized for the disease in the U.S. are younger adults between 20 and 44 years old.
1,I think there are two main questions says Richard Martinello MD a Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist and medical director of infection prevention at Yale New Haven Health.
1,First we need to know how this virus is transmitted between people so we can be more precise in our efforts to stop its spread.
1,Data is needed not only to better understand when those who become ill shed the virus but also which body fluids contain the virus and how those may contaminate surfaces and even the air surrounding them says Dr. Martinello.
1,Second there needs to be a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the infection and resulting inflammatory response so that knowledge can drive the development of therapeutic and preventive medications.. . More information is becoming available.
1,A letter to the editor published in The New England Journal of Medicine in mid-March showed the virus that causes COVID-19 may be stable for several hours in aerosols in this case droplets from an infected person dispersed in air or gas and for several hours to days on surfaces.
1,Scientists from National Institutes of Health NIH CDC UCLA and Princeton University who participated in the analysis found SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours copper up to four hours cardboard up to 24 hours and plastic and stainless steel up to two to three days.
1,While there is much to learn scientists involved in the analysis observed that emerging evidence suggests people who are infected might be spreading the virus without recognizing or prior to recognizing symptoms according to the NIH.
1,But Yale Medicine Infectious Diseases specialist Jaimie Meyer MD MS notes A lot of times people will make basic science observations in the research lab but it takes time for us to figure out how clinically relevant it is.
1,So we dont know yet know what this study means for transmissibility.
1,Until we understand more about the granular details of how SARS-CoV-2 passes from person to person public health dictates that people maintain social distancing wash hands and frequently disinfect high-touch surfaces.
1,Strict measures are critical for slowing the disease. While no one knows for sure how the situation will progress around COVID-19 studies of influenza have shown that pandemics begin with an investigation phase followed by recognition initiation and acceleration phases according to the CDC and that is followed by deceleration during which there is a decrease in illnesses.
1,Finally there is a preparation phase where the pandemic has subsided and public health officials monitor virus activity and prepare for possible additional waves of infection.
1,Different parts of the country can be in different phases of the pandemic and the length of each phase can vary depending in part on the public health response.
1,The U.S. is currently in an acceleration phase when the peak of illnesses occurs and efforts are aimed at flattening the curve. If you map the number of COVID-19 cases over time the expectation is that it will peak at some pointon a graph this peak would mirror a surge in patients which could overwhelm hospitals and health care providers.
1,Flattening the curve would mean there would be fewer patients during that period and hospitals would be better able to manage the demands of patients who are sick with COVID-19 and other illnesses.
1,White House Guidelines for Opening Up America Again  a phased approach to help state and local officials reopen their economies provides advice on continuing handwashing wearing facemasks and taking other precautions even when that happens.
1,While some state leaders have taken steps toward reopening stay-at-home orders remain in effect in many states.
1,Connecticut has a list of guidelines that includes among other directives prohibiting gatherings of groups of more than five people limiting restaurants and bars to take-out service only and directing people to wear face coverings in public when a six-foot distance is unavoidable including in the workplace.
1,The state has extended its guidelines through May 20 unless otherwise modified.
1,Infection prevention is key. There are many things you can do to protect yourself and the people you interact with.
1,As with a cold a flu vaccine wont protect people from developing COVID-19.
1,The best thing you can do at this point is take care of yourself the way you would to prevent yourself from getting the flu says Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist Joseph Vinetz MD.
1,You know you can get the flu when people sneeze and cough on you or when you touch a doorknob.
1,Washing handsespecially before eating and touching your face and after going to the bathroomand avoiding other people who have flu-like symptoms are the best strategies at this point.. . The CDC also recommends the following preventive actions:. . Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
1,Dry them thoroughly with an air dryer or clean towel.
1,If soap isnt available use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
1,Stay home if youre sick.
1,Avoid touching nose eyes and mouth.
1,Use a tissue to cover a cough or sneeze then dispose of it in the trash.
1,Use a household wipe or spray to disinfect doorknobs light switches desks keyboards sinks toilets cell phones and other objects and surfaces that are frequently touched.
1,It may also be important to create a household plan of action.
1,You should talk with people who need to be included in your plan plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications get to know your neighbors and make sure you and your family have a household plan that includes ways to care for loved ones if they get sick.
1,This includes planning a way to separate a family member who gets sick from those who are healthy if the need arises.
1,Some cities and states in the U.S. are requiring residents to wear masks in certain public places like grocery stories and pharmacies.
1,The CDC recommends that everyone voluntarily wear cloth face masks in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain especially in areas where there is significant community-based transmission.
1,A cloth mask is not meant to protect the wearer from infection but to slow the spread of the virus if people who have the virus and do not know it wear masks they may be less likely to transmit it to others.
1,The CDC advises making face coverings at home from simple materials and reserving surgical masks and N95 respirators for health care workers and other medical first responders.
1,While everyone should take precautions measures may be critical for adults over 65 years old the risk seems to gradually increase with age starting at age 40 according to the WHO and those with chronic conditions such as diabetes heart disease and lung disease.
1,People in these categories especially should stock up on household items groceries medications and other supplies in case they need to stay home for an extended period.
1,Experts are working rapidly to find solutions. In the U.S. widely available testing will be important in understanding how the disease is transmitted and the true infection and mortality rates.
1,In addition to COVID-19 testing being done by the CDC state and local public health labs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are currently using the CDCs COVID-19 diagnostic tests although the number of available tests is still limited.
1,Until there can be comprehensive testing for COVID-19 its difficult to know how many cases have not been identified.
1,One recent development is the first in-home test for the coronavirus.
1,The nasal swab kit approved by the Food and Drug Administration in mid-April will be made available to health care and emergency workers who may have been exposed or have symptoms of the virus before it is released to the public at a later date.
1,Meanwhile scientists are studying the virus closely.
1,With the new virus in a culture dish they are looking at the biology and working to make drugs to treat it says Dr. Vinetz.
1,There is also a great deal of effort underway to assess drugs in development and some medications currently available to determine if they are beneficial for treating patients infected with COVID-19 adds Dr. Martinello.
1,While no pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for COVID-19 a number of existing medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies.
1,In early May the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the investigational antiviral drug remdesivir to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease.
1,There is still limited information about the safety and effectiveness of remdesivir when used for COVID-19 but preliminary studies have shown that it can shorten the time to recovery in some patients.
1,Remdesivir is an antiviral treatment that according to the National Institutes of Health was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for treating SARS and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome MERS a deadly virus that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
1,In mid-March the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID announced the first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine called mRNA-1273 developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna Inc.
1,The first trial is testing the vaccine on 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 over approximately 6 weeks.
1,But it could take at least a year before all the necessary phases of the investigation can be completed to ensure the vaccine is safe and effective enough to make publicly available.
