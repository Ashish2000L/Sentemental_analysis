5 Things Everyone Should Know About the Coronavirus Outbreak
Coronavirus
Wait—Now I Should Wear a Mask?
COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)
Our New COVID-19 Vocabulary—What Does It All Mean?
Image copyright Getty ImagesFor the first time, people in England are being advised to wear face coverings in some enclosed spaces.
People in Northern Ireland have been told to consider wearing face coverings if they are in places where they cannot social distance.
Image copyright Getty ImagesWhat face masks are used by health workers?
The most protective mask is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2.
Gloves and other protective wear are recommended for NHS staff working in places where they could encounter coronavirus.
COVID-19: How much protection do face masks offer?
Get answers to your questions about face masks, including how to use them properly.
These discoveries led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to do an about-face on face masks.
Some public health groups argue that masks should be reserved for health care providers and point to the critical shortage of surgical masks and N95 masks.
Like surgical masks, N95 masks are intended to be disposable.
Two big questions many people have are: Will wearing a face mask keep us safe?
There is some evidence that wearing a face mask can protect you from transmitting the virus from your hands to your mouth, probably because you are paying more attention to NOT touching your face when you’re wearing it.
Droplet precautions: Use a rectangular surgical face mask for an infection that spreads by large droplets when someone coughs, sneezes, or talks.
Both the person who is infected and the people caring for them should wear a face mask.
People who have the infection or are at high risk for being exposed should wear a surgical face mask.
You can find our latest features and advice on coronavirus and COVID-19 in our coronavirus hub.
Wearing a face mask might also make you more likely to touch your face because they are uncomfortable or affecting your breathing.
Most people don't know how to put on, wear, take off or dispose of face masks effectively.
You should make sure to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and avoid touching your face, nose, eyes and mouth.
How to wear a face mask safelyIf you decide to wear a face mask, special measures need to be taken to avoid contamination.
Our lives have changed dramatically as much of the world has gone into lockdown to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.
We explore whether creating a routine during times of upheaval can help you feel less overwhelmed.

Ways to keep mood swings at bayMood swings may be common right now, but there are some simple things you can do to limit their impact.
"The best way to keep your mood swings under control is to look after yourself by keeping to your usual routine of sleep, diet, exercise and other activities.
It may be particularly useful if you're feeling anxious, suggests Bailey.

Previously, the agency considered homemade face masks a last resort in hospitals and medical facilities.
N95 masks differ from other types of surgical masks and face masks because they create a tight seal between the respirator and your face, which helps filter at least 95% of airborne particulates.
Disclaimer: this face mask is not meant to replace the surgical face mask, it is a contingency plan for those who have no avail to surgical mask in the market.
Here's what one CDC site had to say about homemade masks then:In settings where face masks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort [our emphasis].
Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19This document provides advice on the use of masks in communities, during home care, and in health care settings in areas that have reported cases of COVID-19.
It is intended for individuals in the community, public health and infection prevention and control (IPC) professionals, health care managers, health care workers (HCWs), and community health workers.
This updated version includes a section on Advice to decision makers on the use of masks for healthy people in community settings.
- Access the guidance
Benefits of homemade face masks Cloth face masks can be made at home from common materials, so there’s an unlimited supply.
While homemade face masks offer some degree of protection, they offer a lot less protection than surgical masks or respirators.
Surgical masks Surgical masks are disposable, loose-fitting face masks that cover your nose, mouth, and chin.
Homemade face masks Homemade face masks only offer a small degree of protection, but they may help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic people.
Surgical masks Surgical masks can’t protect against infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Coronavirus: Your Most Pressing Questions, Answered
Below is a list of five things you should know about the coronavirus outbreak.
(If there any discrepancies, data provided by state public health departments should be considered the most up to date, according to the agency).
So, we don’t know yet know what this study means for transmissibility.
Health care providers and state and local health departments make determinations about who should be tested.
“The public health infrastructure in the U.S. is a critical resource for leading the federal, state, and local response,” Dr. Martinello says.
People following the news about SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, might think coronaviruses are a new disease.
But the truth is that doctors first identified coronaviruses in the 1960s, and there are now seven known coronaviruses.
Though these coronaviruses vary in severity, all have the potential to cause respiratory illness.
So, as is the case whenever a new threat emerges, it’s important to follow specific public health recommendations.
[Click here to learn more about Yale’s research efforts and response to COVID-19.]
It’s just a way to help reduce whatever small amount of transmission could be going on in public.”There are four key things you should know about the CDC’s face mask recommendations:A mask can be made from simple materials .
Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.
Avoid touching the mask while using it; if you do, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp, and do not re-use single-use masks.
For anyone who is still wondering whether to wear a mask, Dr. Kaminski says a smart strategy is to follow all the official recommendations for preventing the virus, including the wearing of masks.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the official name given by the World Health Organization (WHO) to the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that surfaced in Wuhan, China in 2019 and spread around the globe.
The WHO considers COVID-19 to be a pandemic, a disease outbreak that covers a wide geographic area and affects an exceptionally high proportion of people.
Knowledge about the spread and potential treatment of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving as scientists investigate the disease.
There is still a lot to learn about how the virus spreads, and why some infected people have no symptoms at all—or experience only mild cold-like symptoms that resolve on their own.
COVID-19 attacks the lungs, and researchers are also trying to understand why a significant minority of those infected have serious symptoms, sometimes leading to pneumonia and even death.
SARS CoV-2, the coronavirus virus first discovered in December 2019, causes the disease now known as COVID-19.
COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)Just as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19.
Self-monitoringThis simply means checking yourself for COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.
If you have a confirmed case of COVID-19, for example, you may be put into isolation for public health purposes—it may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health orders.
These shortages may leave doctors, nurses, and other caregivers ill-equipped to protect themselves while caring for COVID-19 patients.
Aches and pains, sore throat, fever – although they may feel similar to those suffering from their symptoms, the novel coronavirus is not the same as the seasonal flu, experts stressed Wednesday.
"That said, it is around two percent on average, which is about 20 times higher than for the seasonal flu lineages currently in circulation."
But another Chinese study showed that 41 percent of serious cases occurred among under 50s, compared with 27 percent among over 65s.
That's a reproduction rate up to twice as high as seasonal flu, which typically infects 1.3 new people for each patient.
Health authorities regularly complain that not enough people receive the flu vaccine to guarantee "herd immunity".
Here at Live Science, we've compiled a list of the most pervasive myths about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, the disease it causes, and explained why these rumors are misleading, or just plain wrong.
R0 predicts the number of people who can catch a given bug from a single infected person, Live Science previously reported .
Still, when children become infected, they seem less likely to develop severe disease, Live Science previously reported .
Myth: The coronavirus is less deadly than the fluSo far, it appears the coronavirus is more deadly than the flu.
The death rate varied by different factors such as location and an individual's age, according to a previous Live Science report .
Yes, due to the potentially high infectivity of Covid-19 Coronavirus, this virus is particularly dangerous to humans.
The current research results show that Covid-19 Coronavirus will cause various changes in many aspects of human life.
In addition, Covid-19 Coronavirus is highly resistant to temperature changes.
It is highly likely that Covid-19 Coronavirus appeared earlier before it began to infect humans.
At the time you read this commentary, at least some new strains of Covid-19 Coronavirus will be created.
Coronavirus is one of the common viruses that can cause infection in your sinuses, nose or upper throat.
When it comes to the basic description of the virus, Coronavirus comes under the sub-family Orthocoronavirinae.
Food management : Treatment of coronavirus infection is in the same way as that of cold virus-like taking plenty of rest, drinking fluids.

Why is COVID-19 so dangerous?
|This scanning electron microscope image shows the yellow cells of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 emerging from a lab culture medium.
But of the many viruses known to infect humans, what makes this one, which has caused the worst pandemic in a century, so dangerous?
The virus that causes COVID-19 is not the most deadly.
That added to the fact that it spreads as easily from person to person as influenza, and infects the upper respiratory system, is what makes it so dangerous.
Even the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the fight against the coronavirus is now an "infodemic" of misinformation.
After U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that consuming or injecting disinfectants could help fight Covid-19, health experts fired back swiftly and warned that such unsound medical advice "could seriously harm people."
Experts who spoke to CNBC debunked the following myths about the coronavirus that are spreading.
Apart from consuming alcohol, spraying alcohol or disinfectants all over the body would not help kill the coronavirus either, according to experts.
Does it mean I don't have the virus if I can hold my breath for 10 seconds without discomfort or coughing?
“I think the majority of people studying [coronavirus genetics] wouldn’t recognize more than one strain right now,” says Charlotte Houldcroft at the University of Cambridge.
Read: The best hopes for a coronavirus drugAs an epidemic progresses, the virus family tree grows new branches and twigs—new lineages that are characterized by differing sets of mutations.
“Not every mutation creates a different strain,” says Grubaugh.
Coronaviruses—which, to be clear, belong to a completely separate family from influenza viruses—change at a tenth of the speed.
Yes, the virus has picked up several mutations since it first jumped into humans in late 2019, but no more than scientists would have predicted.
Yet please don’t neglect the fact that 38 million people globally are living with HIV, including 1·7 million children under 15 years.

The new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2.
It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus.
It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu.
The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study.
But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.
It would be unethical to experimentally manipulate viral dose in humans for a pathogen as serious as the coronavirus, but there is evidence that dose also matters for the human coronavirus.
During the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong, for instance, one patient infected many others living in the same complex of apartment buildings, resulting in 19 dead.
The spread of infection is thought to have been caused by airborne viral particles that were blown throughout the complex from the initial patient’s apartment unit.
As a result of greater viral exposure, neighbors who lived in the same building were not only more frequently infected but also more likely to die.
By contrast, more distant neighbors, even when infected, suffered less.

It remains unclear how deadly the new strain of coronavirus (Covid-19) is, or whether it can be stopped from spreading around the world as a pandemic.
What kills patients with coronavirus?
There is no simple cure for the new coronavirus, just as there is no cure for the common cold.
Doctors in around the world with coronavirus patients are also testing and experimenting with new treatments, including drugs designed to combat HIV and other viral infections.
Do coronavirus patients ever fully recover?
One reason for these discrepancies is that they often use two different ways to calculate the death rate.
In this example the true death rate is 1% (1/100), but the CFR is 3.3% (1/30).
Similarly, the stricken cruise ship Diamond Princess is illuminating because the rigorous quarantine meant nearly all COVID-19 cases (even asymptomatic ones) were identified.
Based purely on demographics, the projected death rate in Italy is seven times the rate in Niger; Australia is worse than the global average.
The calculated sCFR value is 1.4%, which puts a likely upper bound on the Infection Fatality Rate in the epicentre of the outbreak.
A Facebook post shared more than 300,000 times made several dangerous claimsBut of particular concern in the short term are those spreading false or misleading health advice.
The misinformation we’ve seen broadly falls into three separate categories.
This week, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the NHS both announced measures designed to combat bad information around this coronavirus.
While plenty of media outlets have been behaving responsibly, we deserve better than the exaggeration and speculation we’ve seen from some.
We face a global public health crisis in the age of unprecedented and rampant misinformation – good health advice can make the difference between life and death.
Editor's note: For the latest updates on the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, see our news coverage .
A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection.
It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.

But does that make Kerala a success model?
Dr A Fathahudeen, who is the nodal officer for COVID-19 treatment in Ernakulam district, is against the idea of calling any place a success model yet.
Mr Bhan says that euphoria over such success models can also put frontline workers at risk.
A person from Yunnan Province died while on his way back to Shandong Province for work on a chartered bus on Monday.
Yes, a man in the Yunnan province in Southwest China was tested positive for hantavirus on Monday.
Infection with any hantavirus can produce hantavirus disease in people.
Stomach problemsAround 4 to 10 days after the initial symptoms of HPS, the late symptoms of HPS appear.
Acute kidney failureAs per the CDC, the severity of the disease varies depending upon the virus causing the infection.
India probably has an innate, natural defence against the deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) after all, if one goes by the latest theory that some experts have propounded.This could sound highly anomalous at a time when India's worst coronavirus fears are seemingly coming true.
In other words, fear now has a new name.But there are experts who see it differently.
"According to Arindam Biswas, and internal medicine consultant, three factors determine a virus' spread — the "agent or the virus itself, the host and the environment".
Fingers are still crossed, but speculations are gaining ground.The experts, however, also have a grim warning — they are not ruling out the possibility of a 'silent transmission' of coronavirus in India .
If an outbreak occurs, India's public health system — in all likelihood — will be overwhelmed in no time.
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
The scientific name for this novel coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, which stands for “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.” Covid-19, however, is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The letters and numbers in “Covid-19” come from “Coronavirus disease 2019.” Myths & misinformationCan you catch coronavirus more than once?
In other words, you probably won’t get coronavirus from the water, but you could get coronavirus from someone close to you in the water.
But many coronavirus patients suffer from shortness of breath, and some people with coronavirus lose their senses of taste or smell.
And in some cases, symptoms don’t appear until up to 14 days after infection.
Experts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus.
Airborne Large droplets Surgical masks are highly effective against large airborne droplets.

Airborne Large droplets Surgical masks are highly effective against large airborne droplets.
Several studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others.
Since their symptoms are vague and possibly non-existent, the case numbers that climb by the day aren’t what they seem.
The symptoms of mild coronavirus are pretty vague except for the fever, which people might not measure if they feel normal.
Whether they had no symptoms, were pre-symptomatic or had mild symptoms isn’t important.
That’s why telling people to stay home if they feel sick isn’t enough — not just because everyone defines “sick” differently, but because people are contagious before they feel sick, and some may not feel sick at all.

On April 27, the CDC added to its list of possible COVID-19 symptoms, including: chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell.
These symptoms could appear two to 14 days after exposureAnd a study in northern Italy found that 18 of 88 COVID-19 patients, 20.4%, developed rashes.
Q: Why does COVID-19 cause serious illness in or kill some patients and leave others with mild or no symptoms?
Overall, 6.8% of reported COVID-19 patients around the world have died, according to figures reported on April 20 by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
Q: How can I tell the difference between withdrawal and COVID-19 symptoms?
Listed below are the coronavirus affected countries and the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus by country.
Sudan earlier announced two suspected cases of coronavirus infection on 29 January, becoming the second country to report coronavirus in Africa.
Coronavirus test results showed that the person was suffering was a common cold, but not the coronavirus infection.
Ecuador was one of the first countries outside Mainland China to have reported a coronavirus suspected case on 26 January.
Brazil earlier also reported suspected coronavirus cases in Sao Paulo, Parana, and the Rio Grande do Sul.
They quickly determined that it was a coronavirus and that it was rapidly spreading through and outside of Wuhan.
Previous US hot spots included a nursing home in Washington; New Rochelle, New York; and the Boston area, where the disease spread at a conference.
The WHO named the illness caused by the coronavirus COVID-19 — “co” and “vi” for coronavirus, “d” for disease, and “19” for the year when the disease emerged.
Each sick person will go on to infect, on average, between 1.4 and 2.5 additional people, the WHO says, though that’s an early estimate.
Other teams of researchers have published their own estimates, with most saying a sick person will infect an average of around two or three people.
Louisa Pietrowsky, 5½, has heart and lung conditions that could make her particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus.
But it is especially pernicious for people whose health is vulnerable, even in the best of conditions.
But people of all ages with weakened immune systems or certain diseases also face higher risks and are experiencing the coronavirus pandemic with particular anxieties.
In addition to being susceptible to respiratory infections, patients with CF already have compromised lung function, so they have less reserve should they get sick.
Trying to keep people away from health facilities unless necessary poses different risks for different groups of patients.
In this blog, originally published on Inspire the Mind on 25 March 2020, Anna McLaughlin, Clinical Neuroscience PhD student at King's College London, explores and debunks the current myths around COVID-19.
The coronavirus pandemic has swept across the globe at breakneck speed, bringing whole countries to their knees in a matter of weeks.
We have also been inundated with conflicting ‘facts’ about coronavirus, ranging from misquoted statistics, to rather convincing pseudo-science and downright laughable conspiracy theories.
This is why we have collected and debunked the top 10 most dangerous myths about the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), using the best charts and illustrations from around the web to visually guide you.
What is most surprising, is that a large number of patients may also lose their sense of smell and taste.
I spoke with a dozen experts about what we don’t know about the coronavirus.
In that context, here are 11 major questions that experts still have about the coronavirus — and the implications of the answers, whatever they may be.
But we don’t know if those people remain asymptomatic.
It’s become a common refrain in media reports that a Covid-19 vaccine is potentially 12 to 18 months away.
The actual timeline for a Covid-19 vaccine could span anywhere from six months — at the most hopeful end — to 16 years.
However using analysis of SARS-CoV-2 virus samples, scientists from the Medical Research Council-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR) have found only one type of the virus.
“It is important people are not concerned about virus mutations – these are normal and expected as a virus passes through a population.
However extensive analysis by the team found these detected mutations are unlikely to have any functional significance, and, importantly, do not represent different virus types.
?There's no evidence #SARSCoV2, the virus that causes #COVID19, has mutated into different types.
New research in @Virus_Evolution by @CVRinfo finds there is still only one type of the virus circulating ????
Scientists are tracking genetic errors, or mutations, in the coronavirus' genome to study its evolution over time.
According to Hodcroft, the coronavirus' mutations are innocuous in terms of its risk to humans, at least so far.
Tracking the coronavirus' spreadGettyAdvertisementWhen labs around the world collect coronavirus samples, they sequence those samples' genomes and upload the information to Hodcroft's team's website — the project is called Nextstrain.
Currently, Nextstrain has coronavirus samples from at least 36 countries on six continents.
A strain that descended from that Washington one also cropped up in coronavirus samples in 14 other states, including Maryland.
Children seem to be much less affected by the coronavirus RooM the Agency/AlamyIt has been widely reported that children are less likely to get severely ill and die from the new coronavirus.
With flu, young children and older people are usually the most severely affected, so why is the new coronavirus different?
But she and other experts suspect it may be down to the unique way children’s immune systems respond to these viruses.
And just because children aren’t getting severely ill, doesn’t mean they aren’t contributing to the spread of the new coronavirus.
“There’s a danger of being complacent about the children not getting severely ill,” says Iwasaki.
Pathanamthitta: Coronavirus (COVID-19) is not as a dangerous as other viral infections such as SARS and Nipah, an expert has said.
He, however, said people have to exercise extreme caution until the Coronavirus is contained.
Excerpts from an email interview with the CCMB directorLower fatality rateCOVID-19 is not as dangerous as Nipah, Zika or SARS.
The fatality rate of SARS virus is up to six per cent, while that of the Coronavirus is only 2 per cent.
People have to exercise extreme caution while at the airports, bus stands or trains.
But That May Not Be A Problem For HumansAs the new coronavirus continues to spread around the globe, researchers say the virus is changing its genetic makeup slightly.
Coronaviruses — like all viruses — change small parts of their genetic code all the time.
So far, researchers who are tracking the genetic changes in SARS-CoV-2 — the official name for the coronavirus — say it seems relatively stable.
Researchers are on alert for changes that might affect how the coronavirus behaves in humans.
Selective pressures could come from introducing treatments and vaccines that are effective against a narrow group of coronavirus strains.
If you look at the numbers, coronavirus is clearly the more dangerous adversary — keeping in mind, as Poland pointed out, that doctors only have about three months of data.
They are “literally building the airplane while they fly it.” A crucial number that is among the hardest to get is how many people infected with the coronavirus have no symptoms or very minor ones.
It is important for determining any rates involving the new disease and for now must be estimated.
The number of coronavirus cases globally is nearing 90,000, with fears of a possible pandemic.

The government has now declared that coronavirus is a “serious and imminent threat”, which will give doctors more powers to forcibly isolate suspected coronavirus cases.
The central province of Hubei, where the coronavirus outbreak started and nearly all deaths have occurred, has been placed in lockdown.

However, coronavirus have been incriminated in the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, and also the Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS.
The American Supreme Court has already declared that because virus are precent in nature, there can be no patent for a virus sequence.
The MERS virus similarly vaulted from bats to camels and thence to humans.
The new virus genome sequence suggests its is 80% similar to the SARS virus.
The 2019-nCoV virus has already been detected in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan,Vietnam and as close as Nepal.
The fast spread of a new coronavirus in China has prompted global alarm, with neighbouring states closing their borders, global airlines suspending flights and some governments barring entry to foreign nationals who have recently been to the Asian country.
Key questions answeredSo just how dangerous is COVID-19 and how worried should you be?
The new coronavirus is part of a family of viruses that include the common cold and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China in 2002.
It spreads primarily through droplets dispersed when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and can also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces.
However, it may be too early to estimate fatality rates for the new coronavirus as we are still in the early stages of the outbreak.
The rapid tests have been used by the White House, raising concerns that positive COVID-19 cases may have been missed.
One county in Kentucky had an increase in COVID-19 cases of 650 percent in 1 week.
On Friday, another staff member in the Vice President’s office tested positive for the virus, according to CNN.
This doesn’t mean they never had COVID-19 symptoms, but that they were infectious days before their symptoms appeared.
China may have concealed COVID-19 cases, according to reports U.S. intelligence believes that China may have downplayed the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak, according to Bloomberg News.

Two experts explain some of the facts we do know – and what we don’t yet know about COVID-19.
As of 19 March, there have been more than 200,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the globe, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
A new strain of Coronavirus, COVID 19, is spreading around the world, causing deaths and major disruption to the global economy.
The platform is created with the support of the World Health Organization and is open to all businesses and industry groups, as well as other stakeholders, aiming to integrate and inform joint action.
POLLACK: Each of these viruses seem to affect humans differently, so I think it’s difficult to extrapolate from MERS and SARS to COVID-19.
Influenza (the flu) and COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus that's led to the current pandemic, are both infectious respiratory illnesses.
Differences: COVID-19 and the FluCauseCOVID-19: Caused by one virus, the novel 2019 coronavirus, now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.
Flu: Caused by any of several different types and strains of influenza viruses.
4, 2020, the CDC estimates that there were 39 million to 56 million cases of flu.
*This information comes from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases map developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
The report contains regional breakdowns of when the new strain of virus first emerged and how long it took to become dominant.
Washington was among the first states to get hit with the original strain in late February, but by March 15 the mutated strain dominated.
New York was hit by the original virus around March 15, but within days the mutant strain took over.
If they were designed based on the original version of the spike, they might not be effective against the new coronavirus strain, the study’s authors warned.
If that is indeed the case, it could make “individuals susceptible to a second infection,” the study authors wrote.
President Donald Trump, for one, told Fox News he has a “hunch” that the actual mortality rate is likely below 1%.
Looking at data from countries with robust testing systems does support the idea that the disease’s mortality rate may be lower than 3.4%.
In the U.S., where only seven tests have been administered per million residents, the mortality rate is above 5%.
Even with 638 tests given per million people, the country is still reporting a mortality rate of nearly 4%.
Even when taking the current estimated global mortality rate of 3.4% at face value, COVID-19 looks more like influenza than other once-novel coronaviruses.
In many ways, Dr. John Addlesperger says, the coronavirus isn’t as dangerous as influenza.
Dr. Addlesperger, who’s chief medical officer at Sheridan Memorial Hospital, said about 35,000 people in the U.S. died last year from influenza.
Sheridan Memorial Hospital is preparing to deal with the new coronavirus.
(Courtesy photo)Hespen said coronavirus symptoms are a lot like the symptoms of influenza – fever, cough and shortness of breath – and anyone with those symptoms should stay home.
She said if the hospital suspects someone of having coronavirus, standard precautions will be applied, including putting a mask on the patient.
And, unlike with influenza viruses for which there are several vaccines, humans have not built up an immunity over multiple generations.
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimates that the flu fatality rate is closer to 0.1%.
“There are four other strains of the coronavirus, but the attack rate of this virus is relatively high as there is no immunity to it,” Adalja said.
MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphotoEstimates of coronavirus fatality rates vary, depending on the sample size, country, and source.
No deaths occurred in those 9 and younger, but cases in those aged 70 to 79 carried an 8% fatality rate, and those aged 80 years and older had a fatality rate of 14.8%.

The coronavirus outbreak is rapidly evolving.
The time sequence for coronavirus symptoms vary from patient to patient, and not all patients will have a sore throat, Atmar said.
Not everyone with a sore throat has coronavirus, either, and not all coronavirus patients will develop pneumonia.
Myth: Coronavirus patients will experience a drowning sensationCLAIM: "The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind.
"Fibrosis only develops in the minority of patients and 80 percent of coronavirus patients experience only the mild symptoms of the disease, so this is incorrect."
The incubation period for coronavirus, Atmar said, is two to 14 days.

According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), between 290,000 and 650,000 people die each year from the influenza virus.
Additionally, we already know the influenza virus pretty well, but we have only just started to get to know the new coronavirus.
Fact What is the difference between coronavirus and influenza?
There are numerous types of the coronavirus – which belong to the Nidovirales family – but most of them are not pathogenic to humans.
Coronavirus should appear familiar to us, as we have confronted it in 2003 as SARS-CoV, then later in 2012 as MERS-CoV.
According to the CDC, coronavirus symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure:FeverCoughShortness of breathIt is recommended that if you develop emergency warning signs, including those listed below*, that you seek medical attention immediately:Trouble breathingPersistent pain or pressure in the chestNew confusion or inability to arouseBluish lips or face*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.
For additional information, reference the CDC website.
The recommendation is primarily designed to keep asymptomatic people from unwittingly spreading a disease they may not even know they have.
Here’s what they know so far:What happens when a person is infected with the new coronavirus?
OY: The simple answer is we don’t know for sure.
What’s different is that the coronavirus doesn’t seem to be affecting children in the same way for reasons we don’t understand yet.
EJL: The virus first surfaced in China just four months ago, and we already have 50 papers published on coronavirus.
Below are some myths about the new virus, called the SARS-CoV-2, that causes the COVID-19 illness and viruses in general.
This means there is community spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and anyone, not only Asian people or people who recently traveled to Asia, could be infected.
Only suspecting people of Asian ethnicities could mean that we miss a lot of chances to protect ourselves from getting COVID-19.
Your chances of getting COVID-19 in the U.S. is currently low, but the death rate is higher than for flu.

If one thing has spread faster than the new coronavirus from Wuhan, China, it is worldwide fear of the novel bug.
But as evidence of the severity and transmissabilty of 2019-nCoV trickles in, infectious-disease experts say it’s appearing less menacing than first thought, maybe more like seasonal flu than, say, SARS.
“We don’t freak out about seasonal flu, we experience it every year,” said Matthew Miller, a microbiologist who studies viruses at McMaster University.
“The people most likely to die from seasonal flu are the elderly and the very young … The same is very likely to be true with this new coronavirus outbreak.
Of course, even seasonal flu takes a heavy toll, and the Wuhan coronavirus is dispersing among a human population never exposed to it before, meaning people have no immunity.
Article continues belowA reasonable question: Are there fewer coronavirus cases in kids because of differences in testing or symptoms between kids and adults?
That’s not to say COVID-19 in kids can’t be rough, though: A small but significant percentage of kids are hospitalized.
Most countries closed schools very early, so maybe kids just didn’t get the chance to catch it from other kids.
Another review of real-life school closures found that the timing of the closure was especially important, with closures much more effective if implemented relatively early.
With the set of conditions for this novel coronavirus, researchers estimated school closures alone would prevent 2% to 4% of deaths.
This site is protected by recaptchaIt's unknown whether the coronavirus itself causes blood clots or whether the body's massive inflammatory response to fight the virus is what damages blood vessels and blood cells.
Whatever the mechanism, it's wreaking havoc on the sickest COVID-19 patients and doctors' ability to treat them.
"As soon as you put the cannulas in and you turn the machine on, there's clotting," Cassiere said.
To counteract the clotting, physicians give patients blood thinners, usually medications called anticoagulants that make it harder for clots to form.
It's not uncommon for intensive care patients to be put on such blood thinners, and physicians know to watch for excessive bleeding.
The independent, and hence unverified, claims put the number of coronavirus infected people in the range of 75,000 as on January 25.
It is curious that the World Health Organisation does not list wearing mask as a preventive measure in the case of novel coronavirus outbreak.
Scientists world over are studying the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus published by Chinese authorities in early January.
Mass vaccination against novel coronavirus is still a long road ahead.
The mysteries surrounding novel coronavirus outbreaks makes spread of Wuhan virus a dangerous proposition even though its fatality rate is lower than other epidemic that threatened to become a pandemic.
There is no direct evidence that the infected cats secreted enough coronavirus to infect people, she says.
Pet patrolWith the coronavirus spreading rapidly around the world, some have raised concerns about whether the virus can pass between pets and people.
The other three infected cats were put in cages next to three uninfected felines.
The team later detected viral RNA in one of the non-infected cats, which suggests that they contracted the virus from the infected cats through respiratory droplets.
The researchers infected five young dogs and found that two excreted viral RNA in faeces, but none contained infectious virus.

The coronavirus pandemic originated in China in late 2019 as a cluster of mysterious cases of pneumonia.
The culprit was found to be a new type of virus, now called severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-Cov-2.
It can remain viable on surfaces for hours to days, and may be able to enter the lungs directly when inhaled.
The body’s own immune response to the infection can cause inflammation and organ malfunction.
As of this writing, there have been 143 confirmed coronavirus cases in Israel, with three people in serious condition.

So why didn’t the swine flu overwhelm our health care systems and grind our economies to a halt?
CORRECTION (April 15, 9:40 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who died from swine flu since 2009.
The article has also been updated to make clear that the swine flu infected over 1 billion people by the end of 2010 — again, that does not include all infections since 2009.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) OverviewHuman coronaviruses are common throughout the world.
The most recent coronavirus, COVID-19, was first identified in Wuhan, China and is associated with mild-to-severe respiratory illness with fever and cough.
What's the difference between this coronavirus (COVID-19) and the flu?
More information on coronavirus is available from the CDC: www.cdc.govInfluenza (Flu) OverviewThe flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat and sometimes the lungs.
The most important step in preventing the flu every year is to get a flu shot.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is similar to previous coronaviruses in this way.
This coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is what's known as a zoonotic disease: It jumped from an animal species into humans.
Now playing: Watch this: Coronavirus lockdown: Why social distancing saves livesCan the coronavirus infect cats and dogs?
It examined the susceptibility of a number of species to COVID-19, including cats and dogs, using a small number of animals.
The results demonstrated cats can be infected with the coronavirus and may be able to spread it to other cats via respiratory droplets.
One is whether children transmit the virus as widely as adults do, and whether children are as susceptible to infection.

The incubation period for coronavirus, Atmar said, is two to 14 days.
When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they shed droplets of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids.
The World Health Organization defines contact with an infected person as being seated within two rows of one another.
Landon agrees that we don’t yet know how the coronavirus transmits, but believes the results of this study are applicable.
The reproduction number—R0 or “r naught”—simply refers to the number of additional people that an infected person typically makes sick.
Monto suggests that these public health measures could make a difference in turning the tide against this coronavirus as they did with SARS.
The WHO just upgraded the disease that has swept across 114 countries, killing over 4000 people and infecting close to 120,000 more.

The patent relates to a vaccine for a virus which infects birds, which is another type of coronavirus.
The implication of the post seems to be that the new coronavirus and a vaccine were manufactured before the outbreak.
The post goes on to mention a European patent—EP3172319B1—which it claims is for a vaccine for the new coronavirus.
It’s for a vaccine for a virus which infects birds, which is another type of coronavirus.
For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as false because the patents mentioned do not relate to the new coronavirus and the owner of the vaccine patent is not owned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

But, whereas the US population is only six times greater than that of South Korea’s, the US has recorded 300 times as many deaths and 150 times as many cases.
The difference, of course, being that South Korea doesn’t have Donald Trump, Fox News or America’s 36%.
President Donald Trump is not worried about having had direct exposure to the virus.

“This is insanity, I think this coronavirus hype is bull,” said Rene Rodriguez, doing some late-night grocery shopping in Austin with his wife and infant child.
“I’M NOT CONCERNED”Trump’s address to the nation on Wednesday evening was his most somber public appearance to discuss the pandemic.

Amid the rapid spread of the novel Coronavirus which has killed nearly 5,000 people in the world, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to be dancing to his own tune, underplaying the danger from the threat time and again.
In a memo to SpaceX employees on Friday, Musk said that they were far less likely to die from COVID-19 than car crashes, BuzzFeed News reported.
Musk added in the email that he does not think COVID-19 is "within the top 100 health risks in the United States".
In the US, over 1,600 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported, while more than 40 people have died due to the disease caused by the virus.
However, in view of the global spread of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization has already declared it a pandemic.
This was just the latest in an epic run of such comparisons: “The virus killing US kids isn’t the one dominating headlines,” the Daily Beast advised; “Don’t worry about the new coronavirus, worry about the flu,” said Buzzfeed.
Yeah, sure, but so’s the flu … and you don’t seem to care too much about that!
Yes, we know the flu is bad—no one likes the flu.
During the outbreak of deadly hemorrhagic fever that hit West Africa in 2014, Americans were reassured, again and again, that “Ebola is bad.
The flu is worse.” It’s true that Ebola didn’t become a true threat in the United States, where two people returning from Africa with the disease died, and only two cases of new infection were recorded.
Al-Rai, Kuwait, March 6We’ve all been talking about coronavirus but we fail to mention another infection that has plagued our society: the sectarian virus.
The sectarian virus leads people to delude themselves, promote fanaticism and spread a culture of hatred in order to win the voices of the masses.
We must protect our national sovereignties in order to defeat tribalism.
Unlike coronavirus, the sectarian virus will not go away simply by wearing facemasks or isolating ourselves indoors.
If they re-elect sectarianists into power, the sectarian virus will continue to plague our nation.

However, government advisers in the UK believe that the chances of dying from coronavirus is between 0.5 percent and one percent.
Intensive care specialist Professor Hugh Montgomery spoke to Channel 4 about how infectious COVID-19 is compared to the flu.
Symptoms of a moderate caseDr Amesh Adalja defines a moderate case as coughing, a fever, and a feeling that you can’t get out of bed.
Symptoms of a severe caseSince coronavirus is a respiratory disease - meaning it effect the lungs - it can in severe case cause pneumonia.
About 14 per cent of people who contract the COVID-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital – with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia.
What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives – which puts others at risk.
For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 per cent and for those in their 60s, 4 per cent.
There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms – such as fever and respiratory problems.
Scientists predict the UK would see a coronavirus peak two to three months after sustained person-to-person transmission becomes established.
Americans of all ages have faced serious health complications amid the new coronavirus outbreak, a federal health report says.
The CDC report released Wednesday tracked the health outcomes from February 12 to March 16 for the 2,449 COVID-19 patients in the U.S. whose ages were known.
Everything to know about the infection processHowever, that doesn't mean younger Americans will not face serious health outcomes, either, the report shows.
Anywhere from 14% to 21% of adults ages 20 to 44 with COVID-19 have been hospitalized, the CDC data estimates.
There were no ICU cases among people under 19.
The virus has spread rapidly across the world, affecting nearly one lakh people in 66 countries now.
But the World Health Organisation has confirmed that the global mortality rate for COVID-19 is 3.4%, far less than say that for, say, cardiovascular diseases.
In China, about 36,000 coronavirus patients have already been discharged from hospitals, and official data shows that so far only 2.3% of those affected have died.
The flood of information available on the internet and social media, and those viral WhatsApp forwards, make it difficult to separate fact from fiction, while myths surrounding the virus range from stupid to bizarre.
The breakout of the virus has also inspired several racist and insensitive jokes.
Then last week, when asked about whether cash could spread coronavirus, a spokesman from the World Health Organization apparently told the UK newspaper the Daily Telegraph that “it’s a good idea to use contactless payments” when possible.
(Later, the WHO clarified that this was not actually coronavirus-specific guidance, and that it has not issued any official warnings about cash.)
But the truth is, there isn’t much evidence that quitting cash would make a difference, at least in the case of Covid-19.
Here’s what we know: Infectious viruses, including other coronavirus varieties, can live on inanimate surfaces (pdf) including metal, paper, and plastic for hours to days.
What we don’t know, says Eisenberg, is how capable this virus is of being transmitted to humans from inanimate surfaces of any kind.
This column, posted in early February 2020, captured the uncertainty of the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
So why is the public so panicked over this outbreak?Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has some obvious differences from the flu virus.
We are not sure when patients exposed to coronavirus become infectious or how long infected patients remain contagious, so isolation strategies are difficult to develop.
In any case, wearing masks affords little protection against coronavirus since the virus is small enough to penetrate the microfibers of most masks.
The current coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China, serves as a surrogate for a good deal of xenophobia and fear of the country itself.The views expressed are the authors and not reflective of the publication or its owners.
Four of them are common worldwide and just about everyone in the world has probably had one of these at least once as they manifest the symptoms and usual course of common colds.
Occasionally, an individual infection may be strong enough to result in pneumonia or bronchitis.
These types are 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1.
The remaining three have produced much more severe outbreaks.
This last one is the coronavirus from Wuhan.
It takes around 14 days for the symptoms to appear in an infected person.
Also Read - COVID-19 infection may lead to post-traumatic stress disorderAs for India, our government is taking every possible measure against this outbreak, including increasing vigil at airports, hotels, etc.
But one thing is clear for sure, that this infection can spread to the lower respiratory system and become very dangerous.
How does the virus spread?
The virus spreads if you:Have contact with someone who is already infectedBreathe in droplets released from an infected person, when he/she sneezes/coughs.
Image copyright Getty ImagesMyths around the risks of coronavirus in the UK are doing the rounds.
Face masks need to be changed frequently (because they get sweaty), if they are to offer any real protection.
He added: "We need to find out more, but we don't need to panic - I doubt it could spread to another dog or a human because of the low levels of the virus."
Prof Ball, from Nottingham University, recommends good personal and hand hygiene to protect against flu and coronavirus.
Scientists still don't know exactly how the new virus is spread but it does seem to be very infectious.
"Someone in their 80s has a pretty high risk of not leaving the hospital" if treated for COVID-19, Mina says.
A World Health Organization study from 2019 found that 47.6% of Chinese men smoke, compared to only 1.8% of Chinese women.

NEW DELHI : The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads less efficiently than the influenza or flu virus.
However, the WHO also noted that the illness caused by coronavirus is more severe than that of the flu.
The WHO chief observed, "as we get more data, we are understanding this virus, and the disease it causes, more and more."
Some countries are looking for cases of coronavirus using surveillance systems for influenza and other respiratory diseases."
Meanwhile, 12 new countries have reported their first cases, and there are now 21 countries with one case reported from each country.
The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is the most severe sociopolitical crisis Chinese leaders have grappled with since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.
The spread of the virus across borders—and the panicky reaction to that spread—will have profound effects on the global economy, politics, security, and governance.
We still don’t have a clear idea of its transmissibility and virulence.
We do not have a clear idea of the incubation period, which could last up to 24 days.
We also don’t know how infectious people are before their symptoms manifest and why some cases suddenly become severe.

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person coughs or exhales.
The risk of catching the virus from the feces of an infected person appears to be low as of now.

Standard recommendations to prevent infectionAccording to the WHO, standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs.
There are lots of ways to have sexual pleasure without physical contact– try having fun with lone masturbation, sex toys, and phone or webcam sex.
Non-physical contact sexHaving sex with yourself, masturbation, has no COVID-19 risk and is one of the best ways to keep enjoying sex during this pandemic.
If your partner is having sex with other people who don’t live with you, then this increases your risk of getting COVID-19.
Sex with someone you don’t live withDuring the pandemic, some countries are actively discouraging hooking up or having sex with people you don’t live with.
Sexual health services during COVID-19During the COVID-19 pandemic, some sexual health services may be disrupted.
And yet, the internet’s spewing predictions about all the babies that are going to get made during this pandemic.
These to-be-made babies even have a nickname: “Coronials.” So, it makes sense if you’re wondering: Is it safe to go to have sex during a pandemic or not?
This will help slow the spread of the virus from people without symptoms or people who don’t know they’ve contracted the virus.
That said, you *can* contract it by having sex “The intercourse itself isn’t what’s spreading the virus,” Gersh says.
Meaning, even if your partner isn’t experiencing symptoms, they could have the virus and spread it to you if you have IRL sex.
We know that the new coronavirus can linger in spit and mucus, and now it has been detected in semen.
It brings us to our next question: Can you contract the coronavirus from having sex?
But kissing a partner, of course, is far more intimate than a random peck on the cheek.
If you’re kissing or having sex, well, you’re well within this limit...and potentially at risk if your partner carries the virus.
Other than the small study from China, little is known about coronavirus in semen, and it remains unclear whether the virus can be transmitted through sex.
The virus that causes Covid-19 can be found in semen, Chinese researchers report in a small study that doesn’t address whether sexual transmission is possible.
Doctors detected the virus in semen from six of 38 men hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19.
There was no long-term follow-up so it is not known how long the virus may remain in semen or if men can spread it to their partners during sex.
The results contrast with a study of 34 Chinese men with COVID-19 published last month in the journal Fertility and Sterility.
U.S. and Chinese researchers found no evidence of virus in semen tested between eight days and almost three months after diagnosis.
MONDAY, April 27, 2020 (HealthDay News) -- You can't hug or shake hands these days without risking coronavirus infection, but new research finds that sexual intercourse might be safe.
While this small study suggests that the chances of sexual transmission of the coronavirus are remote, it wasn't comprehensive enough to fully rule out the possibility, the researchers noted.
Along with the small number of patients, another limitation of the study was that none of them were severely ill with COVID-19, the authors noted.
And despite the findings, Hotaling warned that intimate contact can still increase the risk of spreading the coronavirus through coughing, sneezing and kissing.
He also cautioned that some infected people don't have symptoms and appear healthy, but can still transmit the coronavirus to others.
Having sex in the time of coronavirus pandemic is not safe.
According to JAMA Network Open, COVID-19 can be transmitted through sex as the detectable level of this novel virus has been found in semen.

According to this Chinese study, the novel coronavirus can remain in the semen of an infected man even after recovery.
This means, having sex post the recovery can also increase your partner’s chance of getting the COVID-19 infection.
How long is too long to be near an infected person?
It’s not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more risk.
Will you know a person is sick?
Fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath may signal that someone has been infected with the coronavirus.

Chinese researchers have found out that coronavirus could stay in men's semen even after they are on their way to recovery.
Out of the subjects, 16 per cent had evidence of coronavirus in their semen.
Coronavirus, like many others including Ebola and Zika, might be able to live in the male reproductive tract.
Ebola and Zika were found in semen of patients who had recovered months earlier, states the new site.
The Chinese scientists said that deciphering if coronavirus can be sexually transmitted would prove to be critical in the prevention of transmission.
For those wondering how to have safe sex during the coronavirus pandemic, the advice hasn't been too, uh, satisfying.
“You are your safest sex partner," New York City Department of Health shared in a memo back in March.
Now, thanks to a new study out of China, published last week, we know a bit more: Coronavirus can live in semen.
To be super clear, more research is needed to answer the question of whether coronavirus can be sexually transmitted.
VIDEO: #LoveInTheTimeOfCorona — Single and QuarantinedBottom line: While we still don't know whether COVID-19 can be spread through vaginal fluids or semen, we do know coronavirus can spread easily if you're within six feet and sharing saliva.
By Kate KellandLONDON, - Chinese researchers who tested sperm of men infected with COVID-19 found that a minority of them had the new coronavirus in their semen , opening up a small chance the disease could be transmitted sexually, scientists said on Thursday.
"Further studies are required with respect to the detailed information about virus shedding, survival time and concentration in semen," the team wrote in a study published in JAMA Network Open.
He said the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sperm did not show whether it is active and capable of causing infection.
"However, the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproduction are not yet known," she said.

If you intend on having sex but also want to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, here's what you should know.
Luckily the city of New York set out to educate us all with a Sex and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) guide.
Regardless, though, you can technically catch the coronavirus while having sex with someone who's infected, sheerly by virtue of your proximity to them during sex, notes Dr. Williams.
That said, the virus has been found in poop samples, according to New York's Sex and COVID-19 guide—meaning anal sex might make coronavirus transmission more likely than other sex acts.
Now that you've effectively taken a crash course in COVID-19 sex ed, go forth and make the most of self-quarantining.
Coronavirus was found in semen of recovering and acute male COVID-19 patients in a small study conducted in January and February in China, though it remains unknown, according to the CDC, whether the disease can be transmitted sexually.
It is unknown whether COVID-19 can be transmitted by semen.
Four of those men with COVID-19 in their semen were at the acute stage of infection, while the other two had already recovered.
The research neither confirms nor denies whether the virus can be sexually transmitted: researchers did not follow up with the participants to determine duration of coronavirus in their semen and whether the men had spread it to their sexual partners.
A co-author of the Wuhan study told the Associated Press that patients of the Shangqiu study were sicker and actively ill, which could explain the differing results.
Can you have sex during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic?
The New York City Department of Health (NYDOH) has issued a set of guidelines entitled “Sex and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)” that doesn’t beat around the, well, you know.
You probably don’t need a picture drawn to realize that having sex while maintaining at least a six-foot distance apart could be quite challenging.
The NYCDOH further elaborates that “having close contact, including sex, with only a small circle of people helps prevent spreading COVID-19.” In this case, “small circle” doesn’t mean some kind of sex seance.
If you do have sex, the NYCDOH guidelines have even more detailed information for you.
As per these tests, around 16 per cent of them had traces of the coronavirus in their semen, indicating that the disease could be spread via sexual transmission.
JAMA Network Open is an open-access global platform to publish medical studies and research.
There have been cases where the virus has been spread through males even months after recovering from these deadly diseases.
While this raises some concern about another potential way of potentially spreading the coronavirus, the evidence available right now appears to be anecdotal.
Therefore, to avoid contact with the patient's saliva and blood may not be enough, since the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in a recovering patient's semen maintains the likelihood to infect others,” the team added.
A new study from Chinese scientists found coronavirus particles in the semen of 16% of the male patients studied.
A new study, published Thursday in the Journal of the American Medicine Association, found the coronavirus in semen, too.
Other research on viruses in semen has shown that the Zika and Ebola viruses can be sexually transmitted.
It's also possible that the coronavirus particles in semen wouldn't be infectious.

What are the risks associated with intimacy in the time of coronavirus?
With this in mind, we asked three experts five of the most pressing questions about intimacy during the pandemic.
Dr Carlos Rodríguez-Díaz: There is no evidence that the Covid-19 can be transmitted via either vaginal or anal intercourse.
However, kissing is a very common practice during sexual intercourse, and the virus can be transmitted via saliva.
Rodríguez-Díaz: Sexual intercourse may decrease during the next few weeks, but other forms of expressing eroticism, such as sexting, video-calls, reading erotica and masturbation will continue to be options.
(CNN) The new coronavirus can persist in men's semen even after they have begun to recover, a finding that raises the possibility the virus could be sexually transmitted, Chinese researchers said Thursday.
A team at Shangqiu Municipal Hospital tested 38 male patients treated there at the height of the pandemic in China, in January and February.
About 16% of them had evidence of the coronavirus in their semen, the team reported in the journal JAMA Network Open.
About a quarter of them were in the acute stage of infection and nearly 9% of them were recovering, the team reported.
"We found that SARS-CoV-2 can be present in the semen of patients with COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 may still be detected in the semen of recovering patients," Diangeng Li of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing and colleagues wrote.
SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has been detected in human semen, according to a new small study.
The researchers note that various viruses have been found in human semen in the past, but that doesn’t mean they can be transmitted through sex.
They discovered that six of the infected men had semen samples that tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
In general, “respiratory viruses are not transmitted sexually in the conventional way we think of sexually transmitted infections,” Dr. Schaffner says.

The coronavirus , as it’s known, has already infected people in at least 60 countries.Because this virus is new, experts’ understanding of how it spreads is limited.
Still, others who are infected with coronavirus never fall ill at all.
The WHO still believes that most of those who have spread coronavirus were clearly ill at the time of transmission, Lindmeier said.Yes.
(Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, which resemble a crown or the sun’s corona.)
If an infected person sneezed and a droplet landed on a surface, a person who then touches that surface could pick it up.
Given the common modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, engaging in certain types of sexual activities may risk spreading the virus.

Sexual transmission is not the same as contracting the virus from your sexual partner.
You can easily contract the virus from an infected sexual partner by activities like kissing — just not through sexual transmission.
That term is defined as transmission through sexual contact and fluids including vaginal, oral and anal sex.
The new coronavirus has been found in the semen of infected individuals, according to Chinese researchers, raising the prospect that the virus could be sexually transmitted.
The study, other researchers warn, also raises many questions.
It doesn’t explain how much viral load was present in the sperm; nor did it examine whether the virus can be transmitted through sexual activity.
The study, conducted at China’s Shangqiu Municipal Hospital, was described in a research letter published Thursday by the JAMA Network of medical...
Researchers at a hospital in China looked at 38 patients seeking treatment for severe cases of COVID-19.
About 15 of the patients provided a semen sample while in the acute phase of their illness, while 23 provided samples shortly after recovering.
“Further studies are required with respect to the detailed information about virus shedding, survival time and concentration in semen,” the researchers wrote.
These results differ from an earlier study involving 12 COVID-19 patients that found all of the patients semen samples test negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Sheena Lewis, a professor of reproductive medicine at Queen’s University Belfast, added this was a “very small study” and that the data was similar to other studies showing low or no SARS-CoV-2 in semen samples.

U.S. and Chinese researchers found no evidence of virus in semen tested between eight days and almost three months after diagnosis.
COVID-19 has forced countries to lockdown cities and entire regions as authorities try to stop the virus from spreading.
Since coronavirus first emerged in China in December, it has gone on to kill more than 14,700 people worldwide.

However if one of you is displaying symptoms of coronavirus then you should maintain your social-distancing and isolate, even within your home.
If you're somebody who has developed symptoms, and you know that you've kissed people recently, you should let them know.
A study by doctors at China’s Shangqiu Municipal Hospital of 38 men hospitalised with the disease found that six of them, or 16%, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their semen.
“Further studies are required with respect to the detailed information about virus shedding, survival time and concentration in semen,” the team wrote in a study published in JAMA Network Open.
A previous small study of 12 COVID-19 patients in China in February and March found that all of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 in semen samples.

Sheena Lewis, a professor of reproductive medicine at Queen’s University Belfast, stressed that this was a “very small study” and said its findings were in keeping with other small studies showing low or no SARS-CoV-2 in tests of semen samples.
Do's And Don'ts That We Better KnowBased on current evidence, the novel coronavirus is not present in sexual fluids of anyone carrying the infection.
Here's Q&A on all the sex-related queries in the time of coronavirus:Q: What is considered "safe sex" right now?
(And of course, if you do have sex, your risk for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases remains the same, and the previous definition of “safe sex” still applies.)
Q: What will safe sex look like in the future?
A: Right now the only safe sex is no sex with partners outside your household.
As the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 continues to spread widely in the US and beyond, restrictions that promote social distancing do, too.
All of us should be practicing social distancing at this time due to the pandemic, and dating does not comply with recommendations for social distancing.
While this time is challenging, social distancing is of the utmost importance to keep you and your loved ones safe.
Six feet of separation required by social distancing may not entirely slow you down.
For additional information on coronavirus and COVID-19, see the Harvard Health Publishing Coronavirus Resource Center and podcasts.
So, the best thing to do is to come up with some ground rules about how to have safe sex during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Safe sex tips during (and after) COVID-19Several organisations, including Harvard Medical School and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA), have come up with some safe sex guidelines which can help you cope with disease anxiety, stay safe and still enjoy the pleasure of sex once the restrictions are eased in your area.
The next safest sex partner is your spouse or partner who you live with.
Social distancing is still essential to breaking the chain of COVID-19, lockdown or not.

So intimate activities that involve being physically close to someone, or coming into contact with their spit — like kissing — can easily spread COVID-19.
The safest person to have sex with is yourself: masturbation doesn’t spread COVID-19, or any other infections.
Dental dams and condoms may also help prevent the spread of COVID-19 during oral sex by preventing contact with spit.
Being home all day every day with a sexual partner with extra free time might mean you’re having sex more often.
You may also be able to get birth control and other sexual health services at your local Planned Parenthood health center, and some Planned Parenthood affiliates are offering health care services remotely through telehealth.

Its main piece of advice: “You are your safest sex partner.”Here are some other basic guidelines from the organizations above to follow if you’re feeling frisky:Q: Can the coronavirus be transmitted through sex?
A: Assuming you meet all the requirements above for safe sexual encounters, you should still avoid sex if your partner is not feeling well — especially kissing.
That includes anyone with pre-existing medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer or a weakened immune system.
Men who have recovered from coronavirus should abstain from sex in order to avoid passing the virus on via their semen, a new study suggests.
Patients in China who donated samples several days after virus symptoms had faded were found to show evidence of Covid-19.
The findings have left scientists worried that the deadly disease could be sexually transmitted, raising the prospect of health chiefs advising people to avoid having sex for a set time after the end of their symptoms.
One of the patients in the study, at Shangqui Municipal Hospital in Henan Province, tested positive for Covid-19 in his semen 16 days after coming down with the virus and three days after clinical recovery.
"Abstinence or condom use might be considered as preventative means for these patients," the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, said.

The virus that causes COVID-19 can be found in semen, according to a small study from researchers in China.
The study, published Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open, doesn’t address whether this means the coronavirus can be sexually transmitted.
Doctors detected the virus in semen from six of 38 men who had been hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19.
In that study, U.S. and Chinese researchers found no evidence of the virus in semen tested eight days to nearly three months after the men were diagnosed.
Evidence suggesting that other viruses like Zika and Ebola might be sexually transmitted prompted researchers to investigate whether the same could be true of the coronavirus.
Reduce the risk of coronavirus during sexYou may not know if someone has coronavirus.
Masturbation will not spread coronavirus, especially if you wash your hands (and any sex toys) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after.
Emergency Contraception – You can get emergency (hormonal) contraception without prescription from your local pharmacy as usual.
Pharmacies will continue to stay open during the coronavirus outbreak and emergency contraception consultations with pharmacists will continue.

As the global coronavirus crisis continues, questions about how the disease spreads, and the impact it will have on society as we know it remain.
Fortunately, with researchers continuing to learn more about the virus each day, new information has also emerged about the relationship between sex and coronavirus.
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThese are five things to know about the disease and sex.
However, the researchers acknowledged that the small study was not enough to rule out the possibility altogether.
You can get coronavirus from kissingWhile coronavirus may not be spread through sex, that doesn’t mean other physical intimacy is safe – as kissing is likely to spread the respiratory virus.
“Abstinence or condom use might be considered as preventive means for these patients.
In addition, it is worth noting that there is a need for studies monitoring fetal development.
Therefore, to avoid contact with the patient’s saliva and blood may not be enough, since the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in a recovering patient’s semen maintains the likelihood to infect others.”
COVID-19 is unlikely to be spread through sexual transmission, according to a study that found no evidence of the novel coronavirus in the semen or testes of men.
Follow latest updates on the COVID-19 pandemic hereThe study, published in the journal Fertility & Sterility, was not comprehensive enough to fully rule out the possibility that the disease could be sexually transmitted.
"If a disease like COVID-19 were sexually transmittable that would have major implications for disease prevention and could have serious consequences for a man's long-term reproductive health," said Hotaling.
The researchers from China and the US launched the study in response to concerns that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could be sexually transmitted like Ebola, Zika and other emerging viral pathogens.
They collected semen samples from 34 Chinese men one month, on average, after they were diagnosed with mild to moderate cases of COVID-19.
What is Ebola virus disease?
Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a rare but severe, often fatal , often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90% in humans caused by the Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family.
Levels of Ebola virus remain high after death, thus bodies of those who have died from Ebola virus disease must be handled only by people wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and must be buried immediately.
Sexual transmission of the Ebola virus, from males to females, is a strong possibility, but has not yet been proven.
WHO does not advise families or communities to care for individuals with symptoms of Ebola virus disease at home.
In the current situation, since sex is not a priority as a topic of discussion, misinformation can be easily fostered.
Sexual transmission is not the same as contracting the virus from your sexual partner.
You can easily contract the virus from an infected sexual partner by activities like kissing – just not through sexual transmission.
That term is defined as transmission through sexual contact and fluids including vaginal, oral and anal sex.
If you and your partner have no symptoms and have stayed at home, then sex likely poses no risk.
But you may have questions about other possible ways you can potentially contract the virus, whether it's from handling groceries, opening packages, or having sex.
Information on how COVID-19 spreads is limited, but here's what you should know about the transmission of COVID-19 through sex.
How to Have Safe Sex During the COVID-19 PandemicTo best protect yourself from contracting or spreading COVID-19, the NYC DOHMH suggests masturbating — because you're your safest sex partner.
If you live with someone you've had sex with before, it's OK to continue having sex with them, according to the NYC DOHMH.
Ultimately, if you are having sex, be sure to wash your hands before and after and to also disinfect any additional items you may use such as sex toys and devices with screens and keyboards.
Reading Time: 3 minutes -COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.
Coronavirus itself is not a sexually transmitted disease as far as we know now.
Coronavirus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, so kissing someone infected with it puts you at high risk.
Even if you don’t kiss the person you are having sex with, you may still contract coronavirus.
If you’re worried that a partner could be a carrier of the coronavirus but is not showing signs, it’s best to postpone any sex sessions until you know their health status for sure.
Although HIV can be detected in saliva, it can't be passed to other people through kissing because a combination of antibodies and enzymes found naturally in saliva prevent HIV infecting new cells.
Evidence shows that the HIV virus is spread through the exchange of bodily fluids such as blood, semen and vaginal fluids, but not saliva.
How HIV is spreadThe most common way that HIV is spread is through sexual intercourse, including oral and anal sex.
But steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of HIV being passed on to a baby, making transmission in this way rare in the UK.
For example, the risk of transmission can be reduced by:giving antiretroviral medication to a mother and her newborn babygiving birth by caesarean section (where the baby is delivered through a cut made in the abdomen and womb)not breastfeedingYou can't catch HIV from:
The coronavirus behind the deadly COVID 19, has been lately reported to be found in the semen samples of men hospitalised recently.
There has been fear and anticipation amongst scientists and research organizations whether if COVID 19, can spread through Sex.
A team of Doctors in China has detected the presence of the deadly virus in semen samples of 38 patients hospitalised for COVID 19.
This report is a clear contraction to the research results published in the past including the report made public last month in the journal Fertility and Sterility by China.
It is still to be found out how long the virus remains in the patient’s semen after recovering and the viability of the virus.
While these numbers are alarming for sure, what is more worrying is the ever-changing behaviour of the novel coronavirus.
So far, we knew that the novel coronavirus can spread from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes generating droplets in the air.

A study by doctors at China`s Shangqiu Municipal Hospital of 38 men hospitalised with the disease found that six of them, or 16%, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their semen.
"Further studies are required with respect to the detailed information about virus shedding, survival time and concentration in semen," the team wrote in a study published in JAMA Network Open.
Independent experts said the findings were interesting but should be viewed with caution and in the context of other small studies that have not found the new coronavirus in sperm.
A previous small study of 12 COVID-19 patients in China in February and March found that all of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 in semen samples.
He said the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sperm did not show whether it is active and capable of causing infection.
At least six suspected cases of patients infected with the deadly coronavirus have come to the fore in Haryana yesterday.
Director General Health Services Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj talking to DH said that 2 patients suspected to be infected with coronavirus are from Gurugram near the national capital while one cases each has come from Faridabad, Panipat and Nuh in Haryana.
A Mohali resident's case is the first suspected case of coronavirus infection reported in northern India.
His blood sample has been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune.
PGI has alerted the ministry of Health and Family Welfare about the suspected case.

Last week, researchers joined the White House in an effort to make available some 29,000 coronavirus research articles that can be scanned for data mining.
Could the AI systems have accelerated the process and limited, or even arrested, the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic?
Humans in the loopStill, Freifeld said AI systems have limits, and the big decisions must still be made by humans.

Last week, researchers joined the White House in an effort to make available some 29,000 coronavirus research articles that can be scanned for data mining.
There’s currently no evidence that the coronavirus can be passed on through sexual contact but it certainly is spread through close physical contact (e.g.
It’s strongly advised that you don’t hook up with strangers or multiple partners for sex.
Avoid kissing, wash your hands and use condoms to reduce contact with saliva during oral sex.
We're advising that during the lockdown you don’t hook up or travel to meet someone.
For everyone else, you need re-start with a daily dose for seven days before having sex again.
And now, researchers have detected the virus in semen, according to a small study.
Participants provided semen samples, which doctors analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
The researchers detected SARS-CoV-2 in sperm from six participants, or 16% overall.
(The two "recovered" patients whose semen samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had only been well for two to three days before they gave the samples.)
What's more, other studies have not detected the virus among patients who had been recovered for a longer period.
Why HIV Spreads Less Easily In Heterosexual CouplesHIV is sexist.
This results in a large number of different HIV versions swarming about the body — each with its own genetic code.
This made scientists wonder: Is there something special about the HIV versions making it through the filter?
To figure this out, a team at Microsoft Research and Emory University analyzed data from a decades-long study on HIV transmission between "discordant" heterosexual couples in Zambia.
To establish a long-term infection through sexual contact, an HIV virus must first infect a single cell on the genitals.
If we know where the virus hides (aka the types of tissues it infects), we can learn about how the virus is spread.
Since it is a respiratory virus, you can spread coronavirus through your nose and mouth.
Who can spread coronavirus?
An infected person can also spread the virus before they start having symptoms and know they are sick (called presymptomatic).
As the virus replicates in their body, they can spread the virus a few days before symptoms appear.
There are lots of ways to have sexual pleasure without physical contact– try having fun with lone masturbation, sex toys, and phone or webcam sex.
Non-physical contact sexHaving sex with yourself, masturbation, has no COVID-19 risk and is one of the best ways to keep enjoying sex during this pandemic.
If your partner is having sex with other people who don’t live with you, then this increases your risk of getting COVID-19.
Sex with someone you don’t live withDuring the pandemic, some countries are actively discouraging hooking up or having sex with people you don’t live with.
Sexual health services during COVID-19During the COVID-19 pandemic, some sexual health services may be disrupted.
We know that the new coronavirus can linger in spit and mucus, and now it has been detected in semen.
It brings us to our next question: Can you contract the coronavirus from having sex?
But kissing a partner, of course, is far more intimate than a random peck on the cheek.
If you’re kissing or having sex, well, you’re well within this limit...and potentially at risk if your partner carries the virus.
Other than the small study from China, little is known about coronavirus in semen, and it remains unclear whether the virus can be transmitted through sex.
And yet, the internet’s spewing predictions about all the babies that are going to get made during this pandemic.
These to-be-made babies even have a nickname: “Coronials.” So, it makes sense if you’re wondering: Is it safe to go to have sex during a pandemic or not?
This will help slow the spread of the virus from people without symptoms or people who don’t know they’ve contracted the virus.
That said, you *can* contract it by having sex “The intercourse itself isn’t what’s spreading the virus,” Gersh says.
Meaning, even if your partner isn’t experiencing symptoms, they could have the virus and spread it to you if you have IRL sex.
MONDAY, April 27, 2020 (HealthDay News) -- You can't hug or shake hands these days without risking coronavirus infection, but new research finds that sexual intercourse might be safe.
While this small study suggests that the chances of sexual transmission of the coronavirus are remote, it wasn't comprehensive enough to fully rule out the possibility, the researchers noted.
Along with the small number of patients, another limitation of the study was that none of them were severely ill with COVID-19, the authors noted.
And despite the findings, Hotaling warned that intimate contact can still increase the risk of spreading the coronavirus through coughing, sneezing and kissing.
He also cautioned that some infected people don't have symptoms and appear healthy, but can still transmit the coronavirus to others.
How long is too long to be near an infected person?
It’s not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more risk.
Will you know a person is sick?
Fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath may signal that someone has been infected with the coronavirus.
(Covid-19 is the name for the disease caused by the virus.)
The virus that causes Covid-19 can be found in semen, Chinese researchers report in a small study that doesn’t address whether sexual transmission is possible.
Doctors detected the virus in semen from six of 38 men hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19.
There was no long-term follow-up so it is not known how long the virus may remain in semen or if men can spread it to their partners during sex.
The results contrast with a study of 34 Chinese men with COVID-19 published last month in the journal Fertility and Sterility.
U.S. and Chinese researchers found no evidence of virus in semen tested between eight days and almost three months after diagnosis.
Researchers at a hospital in China looked at 38 patients seeking treatment for severe cases of COVID-19.
About 15 of the patients provided a semen sample while in the acute phase of their illness, while 23 provided samples shortly after recovering.
“Further studies are required with respect to the detailed information about virus shedding, survival time and concentration in semen,” the researchers wrote.
These results differ from an earlier study involving 12 COVID-19 patients that found all of the patients semen samples test negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Sheena Lewis, a professor of reproductive medicine at Queen’s University Belfast, added this was a “very small study” and that the data was similar to other studies showing low or no SARS-CoV-2 in semen samples.
What are the risks associated with intimacy in the time of coronavirus?
With this in mind, we asked three experts five of the most pressing questions about intimacy during the pandemic.
Dr Carlos Rodríguez-Díaz: There is no evidence that the Covid-19 can be transmitted via either vaginal or anal intercourse.
However, kissing is a very common practice during sexual intercourse, and the virus can be transmitted via saliva.
Rodríguez-Díaz: Sexual intercourse may decrease during the next few weeks, but other forms of expressing eroticism, such as sexting, video-calls, reading erotica and masturbation will continue to be options.
Having sex in the time of coronavirus pandemic is not safe.
According to JAMA Network Open, COVID-19 can be transmitted through sex as the detectable level of this novel virus has been found in semen.
Also Read - Here's How India's 1983 World Cup Winning Team Will Help Delhi Police in Battle Against CoronavirusThe finding suggests how significant it is to indulge in safe sex during this pandemic.
According to this Chinese study, the novel coronavirus can remain in the semen of an infected man even after recovery.
This means, having sex post the recovery can also increase your partner’s chance of getting the COVID-19 infection.
At a time when people everywhere are confined to their homes due to COVID-19, looking for ways to stay entertained, the question is—can I still have sex?
So this means that rimming (oral/anal contact) and anal sex may spread COVID-19 as well.
But here are a few basic tips from NYC Health on how to enjoy sex and to avoid spreading COVID-19:You are your safest sex partner.
Masturbation will not spread COVID-19, especially if you wash your hands (and any sex toys) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after sex.
If you usually meet your sex partners online or make a living by having sex, consider taking a break from in-person dates.
If you intend on having sex but also want to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, here's what you should know.
Luckily the city of New York set out to educate us all with a Sex and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) guide.
Regardless, though, you can technically catch the coronavirus while having sex with someone who's infected, sheerly by virtue of your proximity to them during sex, notes Dr. Williams.
That said, the virus has been found in poop samples, according to New York's Sex and COVID-19 guide—meaning anal sex might make coronavirus transmission more likely than other sex acts.
Now that you've effectively taken a crash course in COVID-19 sex ed, go forth and make the most of self-quarantining.
For those wondering how to have safe sex during the coronavirus pandemic, the advice hasn't been too, uh, satisfying.
“You are your safest sex partner," New York City Department of Health shared in a memo back in March.
Now, thanks to a new study out of China, published last week, we know a bit more: Coronavirus can live in semen.
To be super clear, more research is needed to answer the question of whether coronavirus can be sexually transmitted.

Coronavirus was found in semen of recovering and acute male COVID-19 patients in a small study conducted in January and February in China, though it remains unknown, according to the CDC, whether the disease can be transmitted sexually.
It is unknown whether COVID-19 can be transmitted by semen.
Four of those men with COVID-19 in their semen were at the acute stage of infection, while the other two had already recovered.
The research neither confirms nor denies whether the virus can be sexually transmitted: researchers did not follow up with the participants to determine duration of coronavirus in their semen and whether the men had spread it to their sexual partners.
A co-author of the Wuhan study told the Associated Press that patients of the Shangqiu study were sicker and actively ill, which could explain the differing results.
SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has been detected in human semen, according to a new small study.
The researchers note that various viruses have been found in human semen in the past, but that doesn’t mean they can be transmitted through sex.
They discovered that six of the infected men had semen samples that tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
In general, “respiratory viruses are not transmitted sexually in the conventional way we think of sexually transmitted infections,” Dr. Schaffner says.

So intimate activities that involve being physically close to someone, or coming into contact with their spit — like kissing — can easily spread COVID-19.
The safest person to have sex with is yourself: masturbation doesn’t spread COVID-19, or any other infections.
Dental dams and condoms may also help prevent the spread of COVID-19 during oral sex by preventing contact with spit.
Being home all day every day with a sexual partner with extra free time might mean you’re having sex more often.
You may also be able to get birth control and other sexual health services at your local Planned Parenthood health center, and some Planned Parenthood affiliates are offering health care services remotely through telehealth.

Its main piece of advice: “You are your safest sex partner.”Here are some other basic guidelines from the organizations above to follow if you’re feeling frisky:Q: Can the coronavirus be transmitted through sex?
A: Assuming you meet all the requirements above for safe sexual encounters, you should still avoid sex if your partner is not feeling well — especially kissing.
That includes anyone with pre-existing medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer or a weakened immune system.
As per these tests, around 16 per cent of them had traces of the coronavirus in their semen, indicating that the disease could be spread via sexual transmission.
JAMA Network Open is an open-access global platform to publish medical studies and research.
There have been cases where the virus has been spread through males even months after recovering from these deadly diseases.
While this raises some concern about another potential way of potentially spreading the coronavirus, the evidence available right now appears to be anecdotal.
Therefore, to avoid contact with the patient's saliva and blood may not be enough, since the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in a recovering patient's semen maintains the likelihood to infect others,” the team added.

(CNN) The new coronavirus can persist in men's semen even after they have begun to recover, a finding that raises the possibility the virus could be sexually transmitted, Chinese researchers said Thursday.
A team at Shangqiu Municipal Hospital tested 38 male patients treated there at the height of the pandemic in China, in January and February.
About 16% of them had evidence of the coronavirus in their semen, the team reported in the journal JAMA Network Open.
About a quarter of them were in the acute stage of infection and nearly 9% of them were recovering, the team reported.
"We found that SARS-CoV-2 can be present in the semen of patients with COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 may still be detected in the semen of recovering patients," Diangeng Li of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing and colleagues wrote.

Sexual transmission is not the same as contracting the virus from your sexual partner.
You can easily contract the virus from an infected sexual partner by activities like kissing — just not through sexual transmission.
That term is defined as transmission through sexual contact and fluids including vaginal, oral and anal sex.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the official name given by the World Health Organization (WHO) to the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that surfaced in Wuhan, China in 2019 and spread around the globe.

Knowledge about the spread and potential treatment of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving as scientists investigate the disease.
There is still a lot to learn about how the virus spreads, and why some infected people have no symptoms at all—or experience only mild cold-like symptoms that resolve on their own.
COVID-19 attacks the lungs, and researchers are also trying to understand why a significant minority of those infected have serious symptoms, sometimes leading to pneumonia and even death.

Aches and pains, sore throat, fever – although they may feel similar to those suffering from their symptoms, the novel coronavirus is not the same as the seasonal flu, experts stressed Wednesday.
"That said, it is around two percent on average, which is about 20 times higher than for the seasonal flu lineages currently in circulation."
But another Chinese study showed that 41 percent of serious cases occurred among under 50s, compared with 27 percent among over 65s.
That's a reproduction rate up to twice as high as seasonal flu, which typically infects 1.3 new people for each patient.
Health authorities regularly complain that not enough people receive the flu vaccine to guarantee "herd immunity".

COVID-19 attacks the lungs, and researchers are also trying to understand why a significant minority of those infected have serious symptoms, sometimes leading to pneumonia and even death.
SARS CoV-2, the coronavirus virus first discovered in December 2019, causes the disease now known as COVID-19.
COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)Just as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19.
Self-monitoringThis simply means checking yourself for COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.
If you have a confirmed case of COVID-19, for example, you may be put into isolation for public health purposes—it may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health orders.
These shortages may leave doctors, nurses, and other caregivers ill-equipped to protect themselves while caring for COVID-19 patients.
Below is a list of five things you should know about the coronavirus outbreak.

“The public health infrastructure in the U.S. is a critical resource for leading the federal, state, and local response,” Dr. Martinello says.
People following the news about SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, might think coronaviruses are a new disease.
But the truth is that doctors first identified coronaviruses in the 1960s, and there are now seven known coronaviruses.
Though these coronaviruses vary in severity, all have the potential to cause respiratory illness.
So, as is the case whenever a new threat emerges, it’s important to follow specific public health recommendations.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the official name given by the World Health Organization (WHO) to the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that surfaced in Wuhan, China in 2019 and spread around the globe.
The WHO considers COVID-19 to be a pandemic, a disease outbreak that covers a wide geographic area and affects an exceptionally high proportion of people.

Aches and pains, sore throat, fever – although they may feel similar to those suffering from their symptoms, the novel coronavirus is not the same as the seasonal flu, experts stressed Wednesday.
"That said, it is around two percent on average, which is about 20 times higher than for the seasonal flu lineages currently in circulation."
But another Chinese study showed that 41 percent of serious cases occurred among under 50s, compared with 27 percent among over 65s.
That's a reproduction rate up to twice as high as seasonal flu, which typically infects 1.3 new people for each patient.

Why is COVID-19 so dangerous?
|This scanning electron microscope image shows the yellow cells of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 emerging from a lab culture medium.
But of the many viruses known to infect humans, what makes this one, which has caused the worst pandemic in a century, so dangerous?
The virus that causes COVID-19 is not the most deadly.
That added to the fact that it spreads as easily from person to person as influenza, and infects the upper respiratory system, is what makes it so dangerous.
Even the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the fight against the coronavirus is now an "infodemic" of misinformation.
After U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that consuming or injecting disinfectants could help fight Covid-19, health experts fired back swiftly and warned that such unsound medical advice "could seriously harm people."

The new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2.
It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus.
It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu.
The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study.
But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.
It would be unethical to experimentally manipulate viral dose in humans for a pathogen as serious as the coronavirus, but there is evidence that dose also matters for the human coronavirus.
During the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong, for instance, one patient infected many others living in the same complex of apartment buildings, resulting in 19 dead.
The spread of infection is thought to have been caused by airborne viral particles that were blown throughout the complex from the initial patient’s apartment unit.
As a result of greater viral exposure, neighbors who lived in the same building were not only more frequently infected but also more likely to die.
By contrast, more distant neighbors, even when infected, suffered less.

It remains unclear how deadly the new strain of coronavirus (Covid-19) is, or whether it can be stopped from spreading around the world as a pandemic.
What kills patients with coronavirus?
There is no simple cure for the new coronavirus, just as there is no cure for the common cold.
Doctors in around the world with coronavirus patients are also testing and experimenting with new treatments, including drugs designed to combat HIV and other viral infections.
Do coronavirus patients ever fully recover?
One reason for these discrepancies is that they often use two different ways to calculate the death rate.
In this example the true death rate is 1% (1/100), but the CFR is 3.3% (1/30).
Similarly, the stricken cruise ship Diamond Princess is illuminating because the rigorous quarantine meant nearly all COVID-19 cases (even asymptomatic ones) were identified.
Based purely on demographics, the projected death rate in Italy is seven times the rate in Niger; Australia is worse than the global average.
The calculated sCFR value is 1.4%, which puts a likely upper bound on the Infection Fatality Rate in the epicentre of the outbreak.
A Facebook post shared more than 300,000 times made several dangerous claimsBut of particular concern in the short term are those spreading false or misleading health advice.
The misinformation we’ve seen broadly falls into three separate categories.
This week, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the NHS both announced measures designed to combat bad information around this coronavirus.
While plenty of media outlets have been behaving responsibly, we deserve better than the exaggeration and speculation we’ve seen from some.
We face a global public health crisis in the age of unprecedented and rampant misinformation – good health advice can make the difference between life and death.
Editor's note: For the latest updates on the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, see our news coverage .
A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection.
It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.
A person from Yunnan Province died while on his way back to Shandong Province for work on a chartered bus on Monday.
Yes, a man in the Yunnan province in Southwest China was tested positive for hantavirus on Monday.
Infection with any hantavirus can produce hantavirus disease in people.
Stomach problemsAround 4 to 10 days after the initial symptoms of HPS, the late symptoms of HPS appear.
Acute kidney failureAs per the CDC, the severity of the disease varies depending upon the virus causing the infection.

But does that make Kerala a success model?
Dr A Fathahudeen, who is the nodal officer for COVID-19 treatment in Ernakulam district, is against the idea of calling any place a success model yet.
Mr Bhan says that euphoria over such success models can also put frontline workers at risk.
India probably has an innate, natural defence against the deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) after all, if one goes by the latest theory that some experts have propounded.This could sound highly anomalous at a time when India's worst coronavirus fears are seemingly coming true.
In other words, fear now has a new name.But there are experts who see it differently.
"According to Arindam Biswas, and internal medicine consultant, three factors determine a virus' spread — the "agent or the virus itself, the host and the environment".
Fingers are still crossed, but speculations are gaining ground.The experts, however, also have a grim warning — they are not ruling out the possibility of a 'silent transmission' of coronavirus in India .
If an outbreak occurs, India's public health system — in all likelihood — will be overwhelmed in no time.
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
The scientific name for this novel coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, which stands for “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.” Covid-19, however, is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The letters and numbers in “Covid-19” come from “Coronavirus disease 2019.” Myths & misinformationCan you catch coronavirus more than once?
In other words, you probably won’t get coronavirus from the water, but you could get coronavirus from someone close to you in the water.
But many coronavirus patients suffer from shortness of breath, and some people with coronavirus lose their senses of taste or smell.
And in some cases, symptoms don’t appear until up to 14 days after infection.
Of 44,672 cases in China, 81% had mild symptoms, 13.8% were severely ill, and 4.7% were critically ill, according to the Chinese CDC.
Experts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus.
Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO.
1 Proteins on the outer shell of the virus allow it to latch onto cells in the host’s respiratory tract.
Several studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others.
Since their symptoms are vague and possibly non-existent, the case numbers that climb by the day aren’t what they seem.
The symptoms of mild coronavirus are pretty vague except for the fever, which people might not measure if they feel normal.
Whether they had no symptoms, were pre-symptomatic or had mild symptoms isn’t important.
That’s why telling people to stay home if they feel sick isn’t enough — not just because everyone defines “sick” differently, but because people are contagious before they feel sick, and some may not feel sick at all.

On April 27, the CDC added to its list of possible COVID-19 symptoms, including: chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell.
These symptoms could appear two to 14 days after exposureAnd a study in northern Italy found that 18 of 88 COVID-19 patients, 20.4%, developed rashes.
Q: Why does COVID-19 cause serious illness in or kill some patients and leave others with mild or no symptoms?
Overall, 6.8% of reported COVID-19 patients around the world have died, according to figures reported on April 20 by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
Q: How can I tell the difference between withdrawal and COVID-19 symptoms?
Listed below are the coronavirus affected countries and the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus by country.
Sudan earlier announced two suspected cases of coronavirus infection on 29 January, becoming the second country to report coronavirus in Africa.
Coronavirus test results showed that the person was suffering was a common cold, but not the coronavirus infection.
Ecuador was one of the first countries outside Mainland China to have reported a coronavirus suspected case on 26 January.
Brazil earlier also reported suspected coronavirus cases in Sao Paulo, Parana, and the Rio Grande do Sul.
They quickly determined that it was a coronavirus and that it was rapidly spreading through and outside of Wuhan.
Previous US hot spots included a nursing home in Washington; New Rochelle, New York; and the Boston area, where the disease spread at a conference.
The WHO named the illness caused by the coronavirus COVID-19 — “co” and “vi” for coronavirus, “d” for disease, and “19” for the year when the disease emerged.
Each sick person will go on to infect, on average, between 1.4 and 2.5 additional people, the WHO says, though that’s an early estimate.
Other teams of researchers have published their own estimates, with most saying a sick person will infect an average of around two or three people.
Louisa Pietrowsky, 5½, has heart and lung conditions that could make her particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus.
But it is especially pernicious for people whose health is vulnerable, even in the best of conditions.
But people of all ages with weakened immune systems or certain diseases also face higher risks and are experiencing the coronavirus pandemic with particular anxieties.
In addition to being susceptible to respiratory infections, patients with CF already have compromised lung function, so they have less reserve should they get sick.
Trying to keep people away from health facilities unless necessary poses different risks for different groups of patients.
In this blog, originally published on Inspire the Mind on 25 March 2020, Anna McLaughlin, Clinical Neuroscience PhD student at King's College London, explores and debunks the current myths around COVID-19.
The coronavirus pandemic has swept across the globe at breakneck speed, bringing whole countries to their knees in a matter of weeks.
We have also been inundated with conflicting ‘facts’ about coronavirus, ranging from misquoted statistics, to rather convincing pseudo-science and downright laughable conspiracy theories.
This is why we have collected and debunked the top 10 most dangerous myths about the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), using the best charts and illustrations from around the web to visually guide you.
What is most surprising, is that a large number of patients may also lose their sense of smell and taste.
I spoke with a dozen experts about what we don’t know about the coronavirus.
In that context, here are 11 major questions that experts still have about the coronavirus — and the implications of the answers, whatever they may be.
But we don’t know if those people remain asymptomatic.
It’s become a common refrain in media reports that a Covid-19 vaccine is potentially 12 to 18 months away.
The actual timeline for a Covid-19 vaccine could span anywhere from six months — at the most hopeful end — to 16 years.
However using analysis of SARS-CoV-2 virus samples, scientists from the Medical Research Council-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR) have found only one type of the virus.
“It is important people are not concerned about virus mutations – these are normal and expected as a virus passes through a population.
However extensive analysis by the team found these detected mutations are unlikely to have any functional significance, and, importantly, do not represent different virus types.
?There's no evidence #SARSCoV2, the virus that causes #COVID19, has mutated into different types.
New research in @Virus_Evolution by @CVRinfo finds there is still only one type of the virus circulating ????
Scientists are tracking genetic errors, or mutations, in the coronavirus' genome to study its evolution over time.
According to Hodcroft, the coronavirus' mutations are innocuous in terms of its risk to humans, at least so far.
Tracking the coronavirus' spreadGettyAdvertisementWhen labs around the world collect coronavirus samples, they sequence those samples' genomes and upload the information to Hodcroft's team's website — the project is called Nextstrain.
Currently, Nextstrain has coronavirus samples from at least 36 countries on six continents.
A strain that descended from that Washington one also cropped up in coronavirus samples in 14 other states, including Maryland.
Children seem to be much less affected by the coronavirus RooM the Agency/AlamyIt has been widely reported that children are less likely to get severely ill and die from the new coronavirus.
With flu, young children and older people are usually the most severely affected, so why is the new coronavirus different?
But she and other experts suspect it may be down to the unique way children’s immune systems respond to these viruses.
And just because children aren’t getting severely ill, doesn’t mean they aren’t contributing to the spread of the new coronavirus.
“There’s a danger of being complacent about the children not getting severely ill,” says Iwasaki.
Pathanamthitta: Coronavirus (COVID-19) is not as a dangerous as other viral infections such as SARS and Nipah, an expert has said.
He, however, said people have to exercise extreme caution until the Coronavirus is contained.
Excerpts from an email interview with the CCMB directorLower fatality rateCOVID-19 is not as dangerous as Nipah, Zika or SARS.
The fatality rate of SARS virus is up to six per cent, while that of the Coronavirus is only 2 per cent.
People have to exercise extreme caution while at the airports, bus stands or trains.
But That May Not Be A Problem For HumansAs the new coronavirus continues to spread around the globe, researchers say the virus is changing its genetic makeup slightly.
Coronaviruses — like all viruses — change small parts of their genetic code all the time.
So far, researchers who are tracking the genetic changes in SARS-CoV-2 — the official name for the coronavirus — say it seems relatively stable.
Researchers are on alert for changes that might affect how the coronavirus behaves in humans.
Selective pressures could come from introducing treatments and vaccines that are effective against a narrow group of coronavirus strains.
If you look at the numbers, coronavirus is clearly the more dangerous adversary — keeping in mind, as Poland pointed out, that doctors only have about three months of data.
They are “literally building the airplane while they fly it.” A crucial number that is among the hardest to get is how many people infected with the coronavirus have no symptoms or very minor ones.
It is important for determining any rates involving the new disease and for now must be estimated.
The number of coronavirus cases globally is nearing 90,000, with fears of a possible pandemic.

However, coronavirus have been incriminated in the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, and also the Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS.
The American Supreme Court has already declared that because virus are precent in nature, there can be no patent for a virus sequence.
The MERS virus similarly vaulted from bats to camels and thence to humans.
The new virus genome sequence suggests its is 80% similar to the SARS virus.
The 2019-nCoV virus has already been detected in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan,Vietnam and as close as Nepal.
The fast spread of a new coronavirus in China has prompted global alarm, with neighbouring states closing their borders, global airlines suspending flights and some governments barring entry to foreign nationals who have recently been to the Asian country.
Key questions answeredSo just how dangerous is COVID-19 and how worried should you be?
The new coronavirus is part of a family of viruses that include the common cold and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China in 2002.
It spreads primarily through droplets dispersed when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and can also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces.
However, it may be too early to estimate fatality rates for the new coronavirus as we are still in the early stages of the outbreak.
The rapid tests have been used by the White House, raising concerns that positive COVID-19 cases may have been missed.
One county in Kentucky had an increase in COVID-19 cases of 650 percent in 1 week.
On Friday, another staff member in the Vice President’s office tested positive for the virus, according to CNN.
This doesn’t mean they never had COVID-19 symptoms, but that they were infectious days before their symptoms appeared.
China may have concealed COVID-19 cases, according to reports U.S. intelligence believes that China may have downplayed the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak, according to Bloomberg News.

Two experts explain some of the facts we do know – and what we don’t yet know about COVID-19.
As of 19 March, there have been more than 200,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the globe, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
A new strain of Coronavirus, COVID 19, is spreading around the world, causing deaths and major disruption to the global economy.
The platform is created with the support of the World Health Organization and is open to all businesses and industry groups, as well as other stakeholders, aiming to integrate and inform joint action.
POLLACK: Each of these viruses seem to affect humans differently, so I think it’s difficult to extrapolate from MERS and SARS to COVID-19.
Influenza (the flu) and COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus that's led to the current pandemic, are both infectious respiratory illnesses.
Differences: COVID-19 and the FluCauseCOVID-19: Caused by one virus, the novel 2019 coronavirus, now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.
Flu: Caused by any of several different types and strains of influenza viruses.
4, 2020, the CDC estimates that there were 39 million to 56 million cases of flu.
*This information comes from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases map developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
The report contains regional breakdowns of when the new strain of virus first emerged and how long it took to become dominant.
Washington was among the first states to get hit with the original strain in late February, but by March 15 the mutated strain dominated.
New York was hit by the original virus around March 15, but within days the mutant strain took over.
If they were designed based on the original version of the spike, they might not be effective against the new coronavirus strain, the study’s authors warned.
If that is indeed the case, it could make “individuals susceptible to a second infection,” the study authors wrote.
President Donald Trump, for one, told Fox News he has a “hunch” that the actual mortality rate is likely below 1%.
Looking at data from countries with robust testing systems does support the idea that the disease’s mortality rate may be lower than 3.4%.
In the U.S., where only seven tests have been administered per million residents, the mortality rate is above 5%.
Even with 638 tests given per million people, the country is still reporting a mortality rate of nearly 4%.
Even when taking the current estimated global mortality rate of 3.4% at face value, COVID-19 looks more like influenza than other once-novel coronaviruses.
In many ways, Dr. John Addlesperger says, the coronavirus isn’t as dangerous as influenza.
Dr. Addlesperger, who’s chief medical officer at Sheridan Memorial Hospital, said about 35,000 people in the U.S. died last year from influenza.
Sheridan Memorial Hospital is preparing to deal with the new coronavirus.
(Courtesy photo)Hespen said coronavirus symptoms are a lot like the symptoms of influenza – fever, cough and shortness of breath – and anyone with those symptoms should stay home.
She said if the hospital suspects someone of having coronavirus, standard precautions will be applied, including putting a mask on the patient.
And, unlike with influenza viruses for which there are several vaccines, humans have not built up an immunity over multiple generations.
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimates that the flu fatality rate is closer to 0.1%.
“There are four other strains of the coronavirus, but the attack rate of this virus is relatively high as there is no immunity to it,” Adalja said.
MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphotoEstimates of coronavirus fatality rates vary, depending on the sample size, country, and source.
No deaths occurred in those 9 and younger, but cases in those aged 70 to 79 carried an 8% fatality rate, and those aged 80 years and older had a fatality rate of 14.8%.

Where did this new coronavirus virus come from?
How can you tell coronavirus symptoms from a cold or the flu?
The coronavirus outbreak is rapidly evolving.
The time sequence for coronavirus symptoms vary from patient to patient, and not all patients will have a sore throat, Atmar said.
Not everyone with a sore throat has coronavirus, either, and not all coronavirus patients will develop pneumonia.
Myth: Coronavirus patients will experience a drowning sensationCLAIM: "The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind.
"Fibrosis only develops in the minority of patients and 80 percent of coronavirus patients experience only the mild symptoms of the disease, so this is incorrect."
The incubation period for coronavirus, Atmar said, is two to 14 days.

According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), between 290,000 and 650,000 people die each year from the influenza virus.
Additionally, we already know the influenza virus pretty well, but we have only just started to get to know the new coronavirus.
Fact What is the difference between coronavirus and influenza?
There are numerous types of the coronavirus – which belong to the Nidovirales family – but most of them are not pathogenic to humans.
Coronavirus should appear familiar to us, as we have confronted it in 2003 as SARS-CoV, then later in 2012 as MERS-CoV.
According to the CDC, coronavirus symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure:FeverCoughShortness of breathIt is recommended that if you develop emergency warning signs, including those listed below*, that you seek medical attention immediately:Trouble breathingPersistent pain or pressure in the chestNew confusion or inability to arouseBluish lips or face*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.
For additional information, reference the CDC website.
The recommendation is primarily designed to keep asymptomatic people from unwittingly spreading a disease they may not even know they have.
Here’s what they know so far:What happens when a person is infected with the new coronavirus?
OY: The simple answer is we don’t know for sure.
What’s different is that the coronavirus doesn’t seem to be affecting children in the same way for reasons we don’t understand yet.
EJL: The virus first surfaced in China just four months ago, and we already have 50 papers published on coronavirus.
Below are some myths about the new virus, called the SARS-CoV-2, that causes the COVID-19 illness and viruses in general.
This means there is community spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and anyone, not only Asian people or people who recently traveled to Asia, could be infected.
Only suspecting people of Asian ethnicities could mean that we miss a lot of chances to protect ourselves from getting COVID-19.
Your chances of getting COVID-19 in the U.S. is currently low, but the death rate is higher than for flu.

If one thing has spread faster than the new coronavirus from Wuhan, China, it is worldwide fear of the novel bug.
But as evidence of the severity and transmissabilty of 2019-nCoV trickles in, infectious-disease experts say it’s appearing less menacing than first thought, maybe more like seasonal flu than, say, SARS.
“We don’t freak out about seasonal flu, we experience it every year,” said Matthew Miller, a microbiologist who studies viruses at McMaster University.
“The people most likely to die from seasonal flu are the elderly and the very young … The same is very likely to be true with this new coronavirus outbreak.
Of course, even seasonal flu takes a heavy toll, and the Wuhan coronavirus is dispersing among a human population never exposed to it before, meaning people have no immunity.
Article continues belowA reasonable question: Are there fewer coronavirus cases in kids because of differences in testing or symptoms between kids and adults?
That’s not to say COVID-19 in kids can’t be rough, though: A small but significant percentage of kids are hospitalized.
Most countries closed schools very early, so maybe kids just didn’t get the chance to catch it from other kids.
Another review of real-life school closures found that the timing of the closure was especially important, with closures much more effective if implemented relatively early.
With the set of conditions for this novel coronavirus, researchers estimated school closures alone would prevent 2% to 4% of deaths.
This site is protected by recaptchaIt's unknown whether the coronavirus itself causes blood clots or whether the body's massive inflammatory response to fight the virus is what damages blood vessels and blood cells.
Whatever the mechanism, it's wreaking havoc on the sickest COVID-19 patients and doctors' ability to treat them.
"As soon as you put the cannulas in and you turn the machine on, there's clotting," Cassiere said.
To counteract the clotting, physicians give patients blood thinners, usually medications called anticoagulants that make it harder for clots to form.
It's not uncommon for intensive care patients to be put on such blood thinners, and physicians know to watch for excessive bleeding.
The independent, and hence unverified, claims put the number of coronavirus infected people in the range of 75,000 as on January 25.
It is curious that the World Health Organisation does not list wearing mask as a preventive measure in the case of novel coronavirus outbreak.
Scientists world over are studying the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus published by Chinese authorities in early January.
Mass vaccination against novel coronavirus is still a long road ahead.
The mysteries surrounding novel coronavirus outbreaks makes spread of Wuhan virus a dangerous proposition even though its fatality rate is lower than other epidemic that threatened to become a pandemic.
There is no direct evidence that the infected cats secreted enough coronavirus to infect people, she says.
Pet patrolWith the coronavirus spreading rapidly around the world, some have raised concerns about whether the virus can pass between pets and people.
The other three infected cats were put in cages next to three uninfected felines.
The team later detected viral RNA in one of the non-infected cats, which suggests that they contracted the virus from the infected cats through respiratory droplets.
The researchers infected five young dogs and found that two excreted viral RNA in faeces, but none contained infectious virus.

The coronavirus pandemic originated in China in late 2019 as a cluster of mysterious cases of pneumonia.
The culprit was found to be a new type of virus, now called severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-Cov-2.
It can remain viable on surfaces for hours to days, and may be able to enter the lungs directly when inhaled.
The body’s own immune response to the infection can cause inflammation and organ malfunction.
As of this writing, there have been 143 confirmed coronavirus cases in Israel, with three people in serious condition.
In the past two decades, the world battled Ebola, SARS and more than one major flu outbreak.
The swine flu spread easily person-to-person, just like COVID-19, and possibly even from people who were presymptomatic.
So why didn’t the swine flu overwhelm our health care systems and grind our economies to a halt?
CORRECTION (April 15, 9:40 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who died from swine flu since 2009.
The article has also been updated to make clear that the swine flu infected over 1 billion people by the end of 2010 — again, that does not include all infections since 2009.
The ways COVID-19 and flu are similarViruses cause both influenza and COVID-19, and their first symptoms are often very similar.
That means one person with COVID-19 goes on to infect two or two-and-a-half people," Dr Senanyake said.
COVID-19 is more deadlyMost people who get the new coronavirus or flu will get better.
"For seasonal flu it tends to be about 0.1 per cent," Dr Senanyake said.
"What we don't want is people getting the flu and COVID-19 at the same time," Dr Senanyake said.
(Charlie Neibergall) ASSOCIATED PRESSThe coronavirus (COVID-19) is the single-most important topic on the minds of Americans and it remains the subject of regular updates from health officials.
Unlike COVID-19, seasonal influenza has never caused stock-market volatility, never grounded air travel and never disrupted the nation’s news cycle.
It’s also how officials in Hong Kong and Singapore are successfully managing the COVID-19 problem today.
A flattened curve could help ensure there are enough beds, respirators and healthcare professionals available for coronavirus patients who go on to develop pneumonia.
“We don’t know” means “we don’t know.” The results could be worse than expected, the same or better.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) OverviewHuman coronaviruses are common throughout the world.
The most recent coronavirus, COVID-19, was first identified in Wuhan, China and is associated with mild-to-severe respiratory illness with fever and cough.
What's the difference between this coronavirus (COVID-19) and the flu?
More information on coronavirus is available from the CDC: www.cdc.govInfluenza (Flu) OverviewThe flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat and sometimes the lungs.
The most important step in preventing the flu every year is to get a flu shot.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is similar to previous coronaviruses in this way.
This coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is what's known as a zoonotic disease: It jumped from an animal species into humans.
Now playing: Watch this: Coronavirus lockdown: Why social distancing saves livesCan the coronavirus infect cats and dogs?
It examined the susceptibility of a number of species to COVID-19, including cats and dogs, using a small number of animals.
The results demonstrated cats can be infected with the coronavirus and may be able to spread it to other cats via respiratory droplets.
Case in point: A recent viral coronavirus “simple self-check test,” which medical experts say is completely inaccurate.
By recommending people to drink warm water, the post implies the temperature of the water inactivates the virus, which Atmar said is entirely incorrect.
The time sequence for coronavirus symptoms vary from patient to patient, and not all patients will have a sore throat, Atmar said.
Not everyone with a sore throat has coronavirus, either, and not all coronavirus patients will develop pneumonia.
Myth: Coronavirus patients will experience a drowning sensationCLAIM: “The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind.
One is whether children transmit the virus as widely as adults do, and whether children are as susceptible to infection.
Coronavirus: hospitals must learn from past pandemicsBut other scientists say the surge in international cases marks a tipping point in the 2-month-old outbreak.
Coronavirus: why a permanent ban on wildlife trade might not work in ChinaBut Cowling says that such measures are unfeasible on a broader scale.
But epidemiologists say too little is known about the current outbreak and the coronavirus to effectively deploy social-distancing measures.
I think what’s important is a basic understanding of outbreaks and how to deal with them,” he says.
When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they shed droplets of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids.
The World Health Organization defines contact with an infected person as being seated within two rows of one another.
Landon agrees that we don’t yet know how the coronavirus transmits, but believes the results of this study are applicable.
The reproduction number—R0 or “r naught”—simply refers to the number of additional people that an infected person typically makes sick.
Monto suggests that these public health measures could make a difference in turning the tide against this coronavirus as they did with SARS.

The patent relates to a vaccine for a virus which infects birds, which is another type of coronavirus.
The implication of the post seems to be that the new coronavirus and a vaccine were manufactured before the outbreak.
The post goes on to mention a European patent—EP3172319B1—which it claims is for a vaccine for the new coronavirus.
It’s for a vaccine for a virus which infects birds, which is another type of coronavirus.
For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as false because the patents mentioned do not relate to the new coronavirus and the owner of the vaccine patent is not owned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
What’s the difference between a real conspiracy and a conspiracy theory?
Historical records show that there were rampant conspiracy theories going on in the Middle Ages when the plague hit Europe.
The best thing to do is tell the public how they can spot conspiracy theories and how they can protect themselves.
There are tens of thousands of conspiracy theories out there, so I haven’t checked them all.
There weren’t people there who took the absence of evidence to be evidence for the theory, or who reinterpreted contrary evidence to somehow support their theory.
A recent Facebook post makes many claims about the new coronavirus causing the global Covid-19 pandemic.
Coronavirus is not pneumoniaThe post, on the Facebook page United Kingdoms of Africa Association, confuses coronavirus with pneumonia.

In Italy, which is second to China in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths, a nationwide lockdown went into effect on March 10.
As of March 17, South Korea had conducted nearly 287,000 tests for the coronavirus, according to the online publication Our World in Data.
I tested negative for pregnancy four times when I had unprotected sex with my husband, but on the fifth test, out of the blue, I tested positive.

When he came out in opposition to the very social distancing measures his White House recommended, so did Fox News.
But, whereas the US population is only six times greater than that of South Korea’s, the US has recorded 300 times as many deaths and 150 times as many cases.
The difference, of course, being that South Korea doesn’t have Donald Trump, Fox News or America’s 36%.
President Donald Trump is not worried about having had direct exposure to the virus.
As President Trump said this week, we are using the full power of the federal government and the private sector.”Trump is known for his informal style in attempts to, for instance, calm markets amid trade wars.
“This is insanity, I think this coronavirus hype is bull,” said Rene Rodriguez, doing some late-night grocery shopping in Austin with his wife and infant child.
“I’M NOT CONCERNED”Trump’s address to the nation on Wednesday evening was his most somber public appearance to discuss the pandemic.
Let’s admit it.”While acknowledging flaws in Trump’s messaging, some of Trump’s senior advisers and other experts praised him for taking certain necessary, but unpopular steps.
Amid the rapid spread of the novel Coronavirus which has killed nearly 5,000 people in the world, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to be dancing to his own tune, underplaying the danger from the threat time and again.
In a memo to SpaceX employees on Friday, Musk said that they were far less likely to die from COVID-19 than car crashes, BuzzFeed News reported.
Musk added in the email that he does not think COVID-19 is "within the top 100 health risks in the United States".
In the US, over 1,600 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported, while more than 40 people have died due to the disease caused by the virus.
However, in view of the global spread of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization has already declared it a pandemic.
This was just the latest in an epic run of such comparisons: “The virus killing US kids isn’t the one dominating headlines,” the Daily Beast advised; “Don’t worry about the new coronavirus, worry about the flu,” said Buzzfeed.
Yeah, sure, but so’s the flu … and you don’t seem to care too much about that!
Yes, we know the flu is bad—no one likes the flu.
During the outbreak of deadly hemorrhagic fever that hit West Africa in 2014, Americans were reassured, again and again, that “Ebola is bad.
The flu is worse.” It’s true that Ebola didn’t become a true threat in the United States, where two people returning from Africa with the disease died, and only two cases of new infection were recorded.
Al-Rai, Kuwait, March 6We’ve all been talking about coronavirus but we fail to mention another infection that has plagued our society: the sectarian virus.
The sectarian virus leads people to delude themselves, promote fanaticism and spread a culture of hatred in order to win the voices of the masses.
We must protect our national sovereignties in order to defeat tribalism.
Unlike coronavirus, the sectarian virus will not go away simply by wearing facemasks or isolating ourselves indoors.
If they re-elect sectarianists into power, the sectarian virus will continue to plague our nation.

However, government advisers in the UK believe that the chances of dying from coronavirus is between 0.5 percent and one percent.
Intensive care specialist Professor Hugh Montgomery spoke to Channel 4 about how infectious COVID-19 is compared to the flu.
Symptoms of a moderate caseDr Amesh Adalja defines a moderate case as coughing, a fever, and a feeling that you can’t get out of bed.
Symptoms of a severe caseSince coronavirus is a respiratory disease - meaning it effect the lungs - it can in severe case cause pneumonia.
About 14 per cent of people who contract the COVID-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital – with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia.
What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives – which puts others at risk.
For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 per cent and for those in their 60s, 4 per cent.
There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms – such as fever and respiratory problems.
Scientists predict the UK would see a coronavirus peak two to three months after sustained person-to-person transmission becomes established.
Americans of all ages have faced serious health complications amid the new coronavirus outbreak, a federal health report says.
The CDC report released Wednesday tracked the health outcomes from February 12 to March 16 for the 2,449 COVID-19 patients in the U.S. whose ages were known.
Everything to know about the infection processHowever, that doesn't mean younger Americans will not face serious health outcomes, either, the report shows.
Anywhere from 14% to 21% of adults ages 20 to 44 with COVID-19 have been hospitalized, the CDC data estimates.
There were no ICU cases among people under 19.
The virus has spread rapidly across the world, affecting nearly one lakh people in 66 countries now.
But the World Health Organisation has confirmed that the global mortality rate for COVID-19 is 3.4%, far less than say that for, say, cardiovascular diseases.
In China, about 36,000 coronavirus patients have already been discharged from hospitals, and official data shows that so far only 2.3% of those affected have died.
The flood of information available on the internet and social media, and those viral WhatsApp forwards, make it difficult to separate fact from fiction, while myths surrounding the virus range from stupid to bizarre.
The breakout of the virus has also inspired several racist and insensitive jokes.
Then last week, when asked about whether cash could spread coronavirus, a spokesman from the World Health Organization apparently told the UK newspaper the Daily Telegraph that “it’s a good idea to use contactless payments” when possible.
(Later, the WHO clarified that this was not actually coronavirus-specific guidance, and that it has not issued any official warnings about cash.)
But the truth is, there isn’t much evidence that quitting cash would make a difference, at least in the case of Covid-19.
Here’s what we know: Infectious viruses, including other coronavirus varieties, can live on inanimate surfaces (pdf) including metal, paper, and plastic for hours to days.
What we don’t know, says Eisenberg, is how capable this virus is of being transmitted to humans from inanimate surfaces of any kind.
This column, posted in early February 2020, captured the uncertainty of the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
So why is the public so panicked over this outbreak?Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has some obvious differences from the flu virus.
We are not sure when patients exposed to coronavirus become infectious or how long infected patients remain contagious, so isolation strategies are difficult to develop.
In any case, wearing masks affords little protection against coronavirus since the virus is small enough to penetrate the microfibers of most masks.
The current coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China, serves as a surrogate for a good deal of xenophobia and fear of the country itself.The views expressed are the authors and not reflective of the publication or its owners.
Some of the worst viral disease outbreaks in recent years, such as SARS, Ebola and coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originated in bats.

Four of them are common worldwide and just about everyone in the world has probably had one of these at least once as they manifest the symptoms and usual course of common colds.
Occasionally, an individual infection may be strong enough to result in pneumonia or bronchitis.
These types are 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1.
The remaining three have produced much more severe outbreaks.
This last one is the coronavirus from Wuhan.
Bach is also an expert on clinical trials, and I asked him exactly what we know about remdesivir, as well as how we should be thinking about standards of evidence in the middle of a public-health catastrophe.
During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed what makes a good clinical trial, why a pandemic is not necessarily the time to speed up the drug-approval process, and the most important fixes for our health-care system.
Our progress has always come from our missteps.” Can you expand upon that in the context of the coronavirus?
When we finally looked at them in randomized trials, they were also causing people to die of heart attacks.
The answer shouldn’t be assumed.”How does a randomized clinical trial for drug-approval work, at the most basic levels?
It takes around 14 days for the symptoms to appear in an infected person.

But one thing is clear for sure, that this infection can spread to the lower respiratory system and become very dangerous.
How does the virus spread?
The virus spreads if you:Have contact with someone who is already infectedBreathe in droplets released from an infected person, when he/she sneezes/coughs.

Face masks need to be changed frequently (because they get sweaty), if they are to offer any real protection.
He added: "We need to find out more, but we don't need to panic - I doubt it could spread to another dog or a human because of the low levels of the virus."
Prof Ball, from Nottingham University, recommends good personal and hand hygiene to protect against flu and coronavirus.
Scientists still don't know exactly how the new virus is spread but it does seem to be very infectious.
"Someone in their 80s has a pretty high risk of not leaving the hospital" if treated for COVID-19, Mina says.

NEW DELHI : The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads less efficiently than the influenza or flu virus.
However, the WHO also noted that the illness caused by coronavirus is more severe than that of the flu.
The WHO chief observed, "as we get more data, we are understanding this virus, and the disease it causes, more and more."
Some countries are looking for cases of coronavirus using surveillance systems for influenza and other respiratory diseases."
Meanwhile, 12 new countries have reported their first cases, and there are now 21 countries with one case reported from each country.
In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would seem like a lot of things could go wrong, but a Harvard professor says in an op-ed piece in The Washington Post that traveling by air may not be as dangerous – virus wise – as you may think.
The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is the most severe sociopolitical crisis Chinese leaders have grappled with since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.
The spread of the virus across borders—and the panicky reaction to that spread—will have profound effects on the global economy, politics, security, and governance.
We still don’t have a clear idea of its transmissibility and virulence.
We do not have a clear idea of the incubation period, which could last up to 24 days.
We also don’t know how infectious people are before their symptoms manifest and why some cases suddenly become severe.

In the same press conference, Trump contradicted his own health officials.
Now, government health officials and scientists are required to coordinate any statements and public appearances with Pence’s office, officials tell The New York Times reports.
If Trump is changing that, it is a threat to public health and safety,” Klain wrote on Twitter.
On Thursday (February 27), Pence announced Deborah Birx, who currently directs the US effort to combat HIV and AIDS, will be the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator.

Conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be proliferating, and some may even be taking root.
What’s the difference between a real conspiracy and a conspiracy theory?
Historical records show that there were rampant conspiracy theories going on in the Middle Ages when the plague hit Europe.
The best thing to do is tell the public how they can spot conspiracy theories and how they can protect themselves.
There weren’t people there who took the absence of evidence to be evidence for the theory, or who reinterpreted contrary evidence to somehow support their theory.
You've probably been infected with a coronavirus strain at some point in your life.
(Some context: Certain coronavirus strains can also infect dogs and cats—known as canine coronavirus and feline coronavirus, respectively—and cause short-lived intestinal discomfort and mild diarrhea.
That said, it's too early to speculate just how contagious this coronavirus strain is, adds Dr. Kohl.
It's true that coronavirus symptoms more or less resemble those associated with a common cold or the flu, says Dr. Nilsen.
However, the important difference between coronavirus and the flu or common cold is that people infected with this coronavirus strain appear to be more likely to suffer significant, potentially deadly respiratory distress (read: pneumonia), compared to people infected with other coronavirus strains, other common cold viruses, or even the flu, he explains.
Weeks after Chinese officials announced the outbreak of a new coronavirus, an estimated 75,000 people have been sickened globally and some 2,000 have died, leading to questions of just how alarmed the public should be.
The coronavirus, or what is now known as COVID-19, began at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan and has since spread to several other countries, including the United States.
As news of the virus spread and death tolls began to spike, many have begun to question how dangerous the new outbreak is.
CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IMPACTS AIRPORTS, TRAVELMost coronaviruses cause mild symptoms, such as the common cold that patients easily recover from.
On Jan. 30, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency — just days after WHO officials announced they would hold off doing so.
Donald Trump has defended his decision to take a contested anti-malarial drug to protect himself from COVID-19, despite dangerous potential side effects and a lack of proof that it combats the disease.
It has, however, raised alarm about its potential side effects, which can be lethal.
The US government has warned the drug should not be taken for COVID-19 outside a hospital setting, but Trump appears to have defied this guideline.
He revealed earlier in the week that he had been taking the drug "for about a week and a half now" after requesting it from the White House physician.
But on Monday night, Trump said he had started taking the drug because he thought it was "good", adding: "I’ve heard a lot of good stories."
On Wednesday, the University of Wisconsin released a statement about the coronavirus outbreak currently affecting Wuhan, China.
The statement released by UW Provost Karl Scholz discouraged students to travel to China and shut down undergraduate, graduate and faculty university-sponsored travel to China.
To lower their risk, Kelly said students can keep up their personal hygiene — washing their hands often, avoiding touching their face, covering their coughs and sneezes.
Those viruses were more highly pathogenic and dangerous but Biochemistry professor Robert Kirchdoerfer said extensive public health efforts shut them down.
“The spread of a novel coronavirus in humans is a serious concern, but the outbreak is being taken seriously by public health officials and university officials,” Kirchdoerfer said.
How China’s Coronavirus Is Spreading—and How to Stop ItUntil the 21st century, the worst a coronavirus, a large family of viruses capable of infecting humans and animals, could do to humans was to deliver the common cold—annoying but hardly sinister.
As of Jan. 26, the new coronavirus has reportedly infected at least 2,463 people and caused at least 80 deaths.
Indirect contact results when an infected person coughs or sneezes, spreading coronavirus droplets on nearby surfaces, including knobs, bedrails, and smartphones.
Yet few children have yet been reported with coronavirus symptoms.
Moreover, if nonsymptomatic people can spread the coronavirus, the focus on symptoms may be causing dangerous oversights.
Doctors warn that the drug hydroxychloroquine may cause heart damage, Remdesivir may lead to low blood pressure or an irregular heartbeat.
Information continues to change weekly, if not daily.”The review shows that heart failure should be a major concern of emergency-medicine doctors.
One of the studies found that 24% of COVID-19 patients were suffering from acute heart failure at the time they were diagnosed with COVID-19.
The authors note that this statistic does not mean that 24% of COVID-19 patients will eventually suffer heart failure.
It’s unclear from this single study if the coronavirus causes heart failure or if it worsens undiagnosed heart failure.

The government is under increasing pressure to abandon plans to reopen schools, as a number of councils have warned their schools are against reopening more widely to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils from 1 June amid safety concerns.
The British Medical Association, a union representing doctors, meanwhile has said schools should open their doors “as soon as it is safe to do so" as there is "growing evidence" that the risk to children from coronavirus is "extremely small".
In the capital, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has written to supermarkets and shops urging them to stock face coverings for commuters using the capital's public transport.
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd US president Donald Trump has said it is a “badge of honour” that the US has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the world as he put it down to the volume of tests being carried out.
It can be frightening to think about the threat, but public health officials in this country constantly remind people that the risk of the disease here is low.
In addition, public health officials report that many of the U.S. cases have been relatively mild infections.
News reports and health officials have reported widely varied estimates of death rates for this outbreak.
Outside China, health officials test anyone with a cough and fever who has visited Hubei — a much larger number — producing a mortality rate of 1.2% to 5.6%.
As a general rule, health officials estimate that 20% of people with a given infectious disease cause roughly 80% of the cases, Hotez said.
Do you have questions about the new coronavirus that you’d like answered?
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-Cov, and now SARS-CoV-2 cause more severe disease, including pneumonia.
The disease triggered by the new coronavirus is named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease in 2019, the World Health Organization announced February 11.
The name reflects its close similarity to the original SARS coronavirus that sparked an outbreak in 2003, the researchers wrote.
Chasing coronavirus Researchers at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering have created a map tracking where the locations of known coronavirus cases are and how many countries are reporting infections.
Novel coronavirus, which is believed to have originated from China's Wuhan, has now spread in nearly 30 countries, including India.
The novel coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.
Myth: Coronavirus only affects older peopleFact: Anyone can get be infected by coronavirus, be it children, adults, men and women.
Myth: There are specific medicines that prevent and treat coronavirusFact: To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the novel coronavirus.

It originally started as mysterious cases of pneumonia reported in China.
It has now been identified as a new strain of coronavirus, which as of today, has infected more than 440 people and killed nine in China.
Although there are more than 440 reported cases, epidemiologists believe there are likely thousands of cases that have gone unreported or undiagnosed.
The new coronavirus infection appears connected to a seafood market in Wuhan City in China, which has more a population of more than 11 million.
At the moment, public health experts don’t believe the risk is as high or as dangerous as the measles or the flu.
The flu is more dangerous than the Wuhan coronavirus, according to experts.
The danger posed the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is not as lethal as media reports would have you believe, according to an expert.
Unofficial data from British and Chinese researchers showed that 39 out of 41 deaths blamed on Wuhan coronavirus were in people aged above 50 years [Quartz] .
Not the time to throw caution to the wind thoughThat said, there is a lot that is unknown about the Wuhan coronavirus.
Additionally, no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus has been developed yet.
As news of the virus spread and death tolls began to spike, many have begun to question how dangerous the new outbreak is.

Here, infectious disease experts across the US compare all aspects of both illnesses, to determine whether coronavirus is any worse than the flu—or vice-versa.
Those flu symptoms often come on suddenly after an incubation period of two to five days.
If the symptoms sound extremely similar, that's because they are, according to Manisha Juthani, MD, a Yale Medicine infectious disease specialist.

Millions of people became infected simultaneously, often dying as their immune systems struggled in the face of new pathogens.
The Wuhan virus (2019-nCoV) belongs to the same “coronavirus” group as Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome virus) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus).
Sars emerged in southern China in 2002 and spread rapidly, ultimately killing around 10 per cent of the 8,273 people afflicted.
Like Mers and Sars, the Wuhan virus causes problems in the respiratory tract and deaths have resulted from pneumonia.
The swine flu epidemic of 2009-10, caused by the so-called H1N1 strain of the flu virus (the H and N types relate to molecules on the virus’s surface) caused much concern.
The growing number of people who are choosing not to wear masks due to politics is increasing concern among doctors as Texas continues to reopen.
"What's happened is your feelings about social distancing and wearing masks have become conflated with political ideologies," Hotez said.
"It should not be political," Turner said.
Greg Abbott, a Republican, is also encouraging Texans to be good neighbors and wear face masks when out in public.
"I, and everybody else with me, encourage all Texans to continue keeping that social distance and to wear face masks if at all possible," Abbott said.
The project, Bat One Health, explores the link between loss of bat habitat and the spillover of bat viruses into other animals and humans.
But this work demonstrates how bat immune systems could drive the virulence that overcomes this."
This rapid tamping down of inflammation may also have another perk: tamping down inflammation related to antiviral immune response.
Brook and Boots created a simple model of the bats' immune systems to recreate their experiments in a computer.
The researchers noted that many of the bat viruses jump to humans through an animal intermediary.

According to the WVDHHR, the case of coronavirus was confirmed in a patient at Roane General Hospital, but it is not the dangerous strain linked to the outbreak from China.
Carr says there are multiple strains of the virus but only four common strains found in the United States.
"There's two other strains that cause more severe illness but the common winter illness we see from coronavirus are four common strains," Carr said.

If one thing has spread faster than the new coronavirus from Wuhan, China, it is worldwide fear of the novel bug.
But as evidence of the severity and transmissabilty of 2019-nCoV trickles in, infectious-disease experts say it’s appearing less menacing than first thought, maybe more like seasonal flu than, say, SARS.
“We don’t freak out about seasonal flu, we experience it every year,” said Matthew Miller, a microbiologist who studies viruses at McMaster University.
“The people most likely to die from seasonal flu are the elderly and the very young … The same is very likely to be true with this new coronavirus outbreak.
Of course, even seasonal flu takes a heavy toll, and the Wuhan coronavirus is dispersing among a human population never exposed to it before, meaning people have no immunity.

By Lisa TanhA frontline physician based in the Greater Toronto Area is warning the public that Canada’s new deal with China to develop a COVID-19 vaccine is “counterproductive” and “dangerous” because of the Chinese government’s longstanding history of secrecy.
CanSino has already started their second phase of human clinical trials, despite the first phase not being completed until December.
Still, Health Canada has approved the first human clinical trials that will run at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University.
“The shortest vaccine development cycle on record is for the mumps vaccine at four years.
Along with the NRC and CanSino’s unusual steps to quickly develop a vaccine, Gill pointed out there are many other reasons why the deal is questionable, some dating back to several years before the outbreak.

Just about a week later, Sobyanin, the Moscow mayor, ordered all nonessential stores and services to close, including Alexander’s nail salon.
Sonin says, “The crisis is unprecedented, and because the government didn’t move quickly and the measures aren’t, to my mind, sufficient, the downturn will be greater.
That’s not being done because they think the way things are is the way the things ought to be.”
Listen to the Podcast Episode Reaction to the various ways of dealing with the coronavirus — wearing masks, staying home, going to the beach, protesting — is often along political lines in San Diego County as elsewhere in the U.S.
Aired: May 19, 2020 | TranscriptRecent polling by CNN and others has shown that Democrats and Republicans react to the federal government's handling of the coronavirus in very different ways.
According to Michael Smolens, columnist for the San Diego Union-Tribune, "There has been little dispute among officials across San Diego County over the local mask mandate and other social-distancing measures, though disagreements exist on how soon certain businesses should be allowed to open."
As for masks, local elected officials may agree on the necessity to wear them, but the political divide is still there.
Michael Smolens joined Midday Edition on Tuesday to discuss how the coronavirus has exacerbated political divisions.
Hydroxychloroquine – sold in the US under the brand name ‘Plaquenil’ – was first approved in the 1950s as an anti-malaria treatment.
The Lupus UK website states: “Hydroxychloroquine is generally the first line of treatment for someone who has been diagnosed with lupus.
Taking hydroxychloroquine as a remedy against conditions it is proven to be effective in treating is not dangerous in and of itself; the danger comes when using the drug in an attempt to treat Covid-19.
Trump’s comments appeared to suggest the has fast tracked the approval process for the drug, taking it “down from many, many months to immediate” – but that was not the case.
In early April, Forbes reported that President Trump had a “small personal financial interest” in Sanofi, a French drugmaker that produces hydroxychloroquine.

PIERS Morgan has slammed Donald Trump's "extraordinary" decision to take the potentially dangerous drug hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus.
THE drug, which is typically used to treat malaria, has become the first to be approved to treat coronavirus in the US.
Two large observational studies, each involving around 1,400 patients in New York, recently found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine.
Dr Conley said him and the President had discussed the potential benefits and dangers of taking the drug.
Studies carried out in France and China have also found not benefit from hydroxychloroquine when it comes to tackling the coronavirus.
The FDA is aware of reports of serious heart rhythm problems in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with azithromycin and other QT prolonging medicines.
Therefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.
We will continue to investigate risks associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 and communicate publicly when we have more information.
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19.
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation and a dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia.
Care home bosses have accused the government of prioritising the NHS and not care homes - and failing to make good on promises of support.
Professor Martin Green, chief executive of Care England which represents care homes, told MPs on Tuesday that from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic care homes were a second thought despite housing the "most vulnerable people".
Shadow social care minister Liz Kendall accused the government of being "too slow" to tackle the spread of coronavirus in care homes.
Sam Monaghan, chief executive of Methodist Homes, which runs 222 care homes and schemes, told the committee there was a "stark disconnect between the ongoing government rhetoric on support for care homes and the lived reality on the ground".
Mr Hancock said today's official figures showed the number of deaths in care homes "has fallen significantly", down by a third in the last week - from 2,423 to 1,666.

According to the Kentucky Department for Public Health, by May 9th–the most recent report available–150 people in Kentucky had died from the flu.
And there is a debate among public health experts about whether extending school closures into the fall could cause more harm than good.
But Paul ignores the fact that while kids aren’t as likely to die from coronavirus, they can still spread it.
The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine has been promoted several times by the White House as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
"Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation and a dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia.
The FDA's warning comes on the heels of a clinical trial in Brazil, which was intended to study the effects of the drug for treating COVID-19.
Not only did the trial show severe side effects from the drug, but it was also unable to provide any evidence that this course of treatment could benefit COVID-19 patients.
Based on this early data, experts currently do not recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, and the search for an effective treatment continues.

However, the subtle genetic differences translate to significant differences in how readily a coronavirus infects people and how it makes them sick.
The genetic material instructs the cell to make around 30 different parts of the virus, allowing the virus to reproduce.
The infection begins when the long spike proteins that protrude from the virus particle latch on to the cell’s ACE2 protein.
The research community learned about structures of the virus spike protein and the ACE2 protein with part of the spike protein attached just a little over a month after the genetic sequence became available.
Bottom line: A biologist explains how the coronavirus infects and how it makes people sick.
Viruses from a diarrhea can be transmitted by hands or other means to the respiratory system of the infected person.
These people themselves could not have or show problems in their respiratory system but they are still able to contaminate other people.
First there is, for individuals, the less dangerous contamination that only affects the digestive system of a patient.
Second there is the very dangerous variant in which the respiratory system is affected.

Coronavirus is a class of viruses known for causing respiratory diseases in humans, and includes viruses such as SARS, MERS, and of course, SARS COV-2.
The current coronavirus outbreak is due to SARS COV-2, a mutation of the SARS virus, which was responsible for a similar outbreak in 2002.

“The public health infrastructure in the U.S. is a critical resource for leading the federal, state, and local response,” Dr. Martinello says.
People following the news about SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, might think coronaviruses are a new disease.
But the truth is that doctors first identified coronaviruses in the 1960s, and there are now seven known coronaviruses.
Though these coronaviruses vary in severity, all have the potential to cause respiratory illness.
So, as is the case whenever a new threat emerges, it’s important to follow specific public health recommendations.

Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.
Avoid touching the mask while using it; if you do, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp, and do not re-use single-use masks.
For anyone who is still wondering whether to wear a mask, Dr. Kaminski says a smart strategy is to follow all the official recommendations for preventing the virus, including the wearing of masks.
