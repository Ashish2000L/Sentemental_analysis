wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after being in a public place or after blowing your nose coughing or sneezing
if soap and water are not readily available use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol
avoid touching your eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands
avoid close contact with people who are sick some people without symptoms may be able to spread the virus
stay home as much as possible and avoid non-essential travel
practice social distancing by keeping at least 6 feet about two arm lengths away from others if you must go out in public
stay connected with loved ones through video and phone calls texts and social media
cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others and when you must go out in public such as to a grocery store the cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected
however do not place cloth face coverings on young children under age 2 anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance
in addition do not use a facemask meant for a health care worker
cover your coughs and sneezes use a tissue to cover your nose and mouth and throw used tissues in a lined trash can if a tissue isn’t available cough or sneeze into your elbow not your hands wash your hands immediately
clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily this includes tables doorknobs light switches countertops handles desks phones keyboards toilets faucets and sinks
who is at a higher risk
older adults people who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility and individuals of any age with the conditions below are at higher risk of getting very sick from covid-19
have serious underlying medical conditions particularly if not well controlled such as heart lung or liver disease diabetes moderate to severe asthma severe obesity and chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis
have a weakened immune system including those undergoing cancer treatment smoking and having other immunocompromised conditions
stay home if possible and follow the other steps above avoid all cruise travel and non-essential air travel
call your health care provider if you have concerns or to ask about obtaining extra necessary medications in case you need to stay home for a prolonged period of time
call a medical professional as soon as covid-19 symptoms start if you are at higher risk
stay home and call your doctor for medical advice and before visiting a medical office older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions should call a health care provider as soon as symptoms start
separate yourself from other people in your home
avoid sharing personal household items such as dishes drinking glasses cups eating utensils towels or bedding wash items thoroughly after using them with soap and water
on your own clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in your sick room and designated bathroom have a healthy household member do the same for surfaces in other parts of the home
wear a cloth face cover if you are around other people  sharing a room or vehicle and before you enter a health care providers office
if your symptoms become severe call to get medical attention immediately warning signs include
trouble breathing
persistent pain or pressure in the chest
new confusion or inability to arouse
bluish lips or face
there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19
the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus
the virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person
between people who are in close contact with one another within about 6 feet
through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs sneezes or talks
these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs
some recent studies have suggested that covid-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms
wash your hands often
some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus
do not gather in groups
stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings
keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick
cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others
loth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2 anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance
the cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected
do not use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker
continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others the cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing
f you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow
throw used tissues in the trash
immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds if soap and water are not readily available clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol
clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily this includes tables doorknobs light switches countertops handles desks phones keyboards toilets faucets and sinks
if surfaces are dirty clean them use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection
then use a household disinfectant most common epa-registered household disinfectantsexternal icon will work
clean and disinfect
cover coughs and sneezes
it’s best to order food online
delivery services dramatically reduce your contact with other people
pay online
 your primary concern while shopping should be the risk of contracting the virus from other people not from food or surfaces in the store while there’s a chance the virus could be transmitted on a surface
try to maintain a distance of at least six feet from other people
take responsibility
you see a crowded aisle skip it or wait for people to leave
be patient
disinfact surface areas
hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol is best
the less you can touch your personal items in public spaces the better
using hand sanitizer the moment you leave the store especially before you get in the car and touch the steering wheel
if you’re sick and have to leave your house
strictly adviced to use mask and gloves
wearing a mask when you're sick helps stop the spread of the virus because it catches viral droplets coming from your mouth or nose
if you can go cashless go cashless
keep your phone out of your hands as much as possible while shopping
better to have as little contact with the cashier as possible
if you have to use cash thoroughly wash your hands after handling
you wipe down all your items when you get home
 coronavirus is a large family of viruses that includes many different diseases sars-cov-2 does share similarities with other coronaviruses four of which can cause the common cold all five viruses have spiky projections on their surfaces and utilize so-called spike proteins to infect host cells however the four cold coronaviruses named 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 all utilize humans as their primary hosts sars-cov-2 shares about 90% of its genetic material with coronaviruses that infect bats which suggests that the virus originated in bats and later hopped to humans
there are currently no drugs licensed for the treatment or prevention of covid-19
while several drug trials are ongoing there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent covid-19
the misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death
hot peppers in your food though very tasty cannot prevent or cure covid-19
the best way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is to keep at least 1 metre away from others and to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly it is also beneficial for your general health to maintain a balanced diet stay well hydrated exercise regularly and sleep well
do not under any circumstance spray or introduce bleach or any other disinfectant into your body these substances can be poisonous if ingested and cause irritation and damage to your skin and eyes
bleach and disinfectant should be used carefully to disinfect surfaces only remember to keep chlorine bleach and other disinfectants out of reach of children
methanol ethanol and bleach are poisons drinking them can lead to disability and death methanol ethanol and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces  however you should never drink them they will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs
to protect yourself against covid-19 disinfect objects and surfaces especially the ones you touch regularly you can use diluted bleach or alcohol for that make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose
countries with hot weather have reported cases of covid-19 to protect yourself make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose
if you catch the disease make sure you treat your symptoms if you have cough fever and difficulty breathing seek medical care early but call your health facility by telephone first most patients recover thanks to supportive care
the most common symptoms of covid-19 are dry cough tiredness and fever
some people may develop more severe forms of the disease such as pneumonia
frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems
the best way to protect yourself against covid-19 is by maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre from others and frequently cleaning your hands
by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes mouth and nose
taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful as it can burn you
the best way to protect yourself against corona virus is by frequently cleaning your hands
by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes mouth and nose
coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose
to protect yourself clean your hands frequently with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water also avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing
hand dryers are not effective in killing the corona virus
you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water once your hands are cleaned you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer
uv radiation can cause skin irritation and damage your eyes
do not try uv rays on your body at home it may severly harm you
cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing your hands with soap and water are the most effective ways to remove the virus
thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever ie have a higher than normal body temperature because of infection with the new coronavirus
it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever
vaccines against pneumonia such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b hib vaccine do not provide protection against the new coronavirus
the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against corona virus and who is supporting their efforts
although these vaccines are not effective against corona virus vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health
there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus
there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold however regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections
garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties however there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus
people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus
older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma diabetes heart disease appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus
good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene
antibiotics do not work against viruses only bacteria
antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment from corona virus or covid-19
anyone can get coronavirus
the organization also says that uv lamps shouldnt be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body because the radiation can irritate skin
anyone of any age can get the new coronavirus though older people and those with pre existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to serious infections
a novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness like the common cold
covid-19 is caused by a coronavirus called sars-cov-2 coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals including camels cattle cats and bats  rarely animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people this occurred with mers-cov and sars-cov and now with the virus that causes covid-19 the sars-cov-2 virus is a betacoronavirus like mers-cov and sars-cov all three of these viruses have their origins in bats the sequences from us patients are similar to the one that china initially posted suggesting a likely single recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir however the exact source of this virus is unknown
the virus that causes covid-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another within about 6 feet
covid-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community community spread in many affected geographic areas community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area including some who are not sure how or where they became infected
the virus that causes covid-19 is spreading from person-to-person people are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic the sickest that is why cdc recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home depending on how sick they are until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others more recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons
quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness symptoms from others who have not been exposed in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure for covid-19 the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days someone who has been released from covid-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period
coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets currently there is no evidence to support transmission of covid-19 associated with food before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing and wash your hands after blowing your nose coughing or sneezing or going to the bathroom
it may be possible that a person can get covid-19 by touching a surface or object like a packaging container that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth nose or possibly their eyes but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads
in general because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging
community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area including some who are not sure how or where they became infected
generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments however we don't have direct data for this virus nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point the necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface the environment etc
at this time cdc has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks the main way that covid-19 spreads is from person to person
cough
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
or at least two of these symptoms fever chills repeated shaking with chills muscle pain headache sore throatnew loss of taste or smell
most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested
if you have symptoms of covid-19 and want to get tested call your healthcare provider first
you can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing
if you test negative for covid-19 by a viral test you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected however that does not mean you will not get sick the test result only means that you did not have covid-19 at the time of testing
cleaning with soap and water removes germs dirt and impurities from surfaces it lowers the risk of spreading infection disinfecting kills germs on surfaces by killing germs on a surface after cleaning it can further lower the risk of spreading infection
routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment surfaces frequently touched by multiple people such as door handles bathroom surfaces and handrails should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use more frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use for example certain surfaces and objects in public spaces such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads should be cleaned and disinfected before each use cleaning removes dirt and impurities including germs from surfaces cleaning alone does not kill germs but it reduces the number of germs on a surface
cleaning does not kill germs but by removing them it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection if a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have covid-19 the surface should be cleaned and disinfected disinfecting kills germs on surfaces
outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of covid-19 to the public you should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas if practical high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal such as grab bars and railings should be cleaned routinely cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces eg play structures benches tables or groundcovers eg mulch sand is not recommended
pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick like canine and feline coronaviruses these other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current covid-19 outbreak
avoid contact with your pet if your are infected with coronavirus  including petting snuggling being kissed or licked sharing food or bedding
close contact is defined as being within approximately 6 feet 2 meters of a covid-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for living with visiting or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a covid-19 case
keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers out of children’s reach teach them how to apply the sanitizer and monitor its use
apply a coin-sized amount on your hands there is no need to use a large amount of the product
avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose immediately after using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer as it can cause irritation
hand sanitizers recommended to protect against covid-19 are alcohol-based and therefore can be flammable do not use before handling fire or cooking
under no circumstance drink or let children swallow an alcohol-based hand sanitizer it can be poisonous
remember that washing your hands with soap and water is also effective against covid-19
regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water
washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands
maintain at least 1 metre 3 feet distance between yourself and others why? when someone coughs sneezes or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus
avoid going to crowded places
maintain physical distance of 6 feet
avoid touching eyes nose and mouth why? hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses
once contaminated hands can transfer the virus to your eyes nose or mouth from there the virus can enter your body and infect you
make sure you and the people around you follow good respiratory hygiene
this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze
then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands
stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough headache mild fever until you recover have someone bring you supplies if you need to leave your house wear a mask to avoid infecting others why? avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible covid-19 and other viruses
if you have a fever cough and difficulty breathing seek medical attention but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority
applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause harm especially if it enters the eyes or mouth although people can use these chemicals to disinfect surfaces they should not use them on the skin
chlorine and alcohol products cannot kill viruses within the body
sars-cov-2 like other coronaviruses can infect people of any age however older adults and individuals with preexisting health conditions such as diabetes or asthma are more likely to become severely ill
all age groups can contract sars-cov-2
sars-cov-2 causes an illness that does have flu-like symptoms such as aches a fever and a cough similarly both covid-19 and the flu can be mild severe or in rare cases fatal both can also lead to pneumonia
mild symptoms may include a fever a cough a sore throat tiredness and shortness of breath
hand dryers do not kill coronavirus the best way to protect oneself and others from the virus is to wash the hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub
antibiotics only kill bacteria they do not kill viruses
thermal scanners can detect whether or not someone has a fever however other conditions such as seasonal flu can also produce a fever
some research suggests that garlic might slow the growth of some species of bacteria
some viruses such as cold and flu viruses do spread more easily in the colder months but that does not mean that they stop entirely when conditions become milder
alcohol can disinfect the skin
consuming any alcohol poses health risks but consuming high-strength ethyl alcohol ethanol particularly if it has been adulterated with methanol can result in severe health consequences including death
consuming or injecting disinfectant or bleach will not remove viruses from the body
avoiding close contact with people who appear to be sick
trying not to touch the eyes nose or mouth
staying at home if sick
sneezing into a tissue then throwing it in the trash or sneezing into the crook of the elbow
using standard cleaning sprays and wipes to disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces
washing the hands with soap regularly for at least 20 seconds
wearing a cloth face covering in stores pharmacies and other public settings
it is important every individual protects him or herself by taking the necessary precautionary measures
corona is dangerous
covid-19 is dangerous
coronavirus is dangerous
stay safe stay at home
there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases the normal human body temperature remains around 365â°c to 37â°c regardless of the external temperature or weather the most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water
most of the people who catch covid-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies if you catch the disease make sure you treat your symptoms if you have cough fever and difficulty breathing seek medical care early â€ but call your health facility by telephone first most patients recover thanks to supportive care
you can catch covid-19 no matter how sunny or hot the weather is countries with hot weather have reported cases of covid-19 to protect yourself make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose
do not under any circumstance spray or introduce bleach or any other disinfectant into your body these substances can be poisonous if ingested and cause irritation and damage to your skin and eyesbleach and disinfectant should be used carefully to disinfect surfaces only remember to keep chlorine bleach and other disinfectants out of reach of children
to date there is no evidence or information to suggest that the covid-19 virus transmitted through houseflies the virus that cause covid-19 spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs sneezes or speaks you can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes nose or mouth before washing your hands to protect yourself keep at least 1-metre distance from others and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces clean your hands thoroughly and often and avoid touching your eyes mouth and nose
hot peppers in your food though very tasty cannot prevent or cure covid-19 the best way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is to keep at least 1 metre away from others and to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly it is also beneficial for your general health to maintain a balanced diet stay well hydrated exercise regularly and sleep well
while several drug trials are ongoing there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent covid-19 the misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death who is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat covid-19
thermal scanners are only helpful in  detecting people who have developed fever due to covid-19 but not actually covid-19 the systems can sense elevated skin temperatures they arenâ€™t precise enough to tell whether someone has a fever or something else
you cannot expect fever and symptom screening to be any kind of foolproof measure of having corona virus
dean koontzs 1981 novel did not predict covid-19 pandemic
the eyes of darkness novel did not predicted the covid-19 pandemic
world health organization officials announced an average case fatality rate of 34 per cent in case of covid-19
drinking or gargling with hot water or eating ice cream does not make a difference to coronavirus infections
neither cold nor hot temperatures can kill coronavirus
trying to kill the virus by drinking or washing with hot water can burn the skin
the novel coronavirus is a new strain in the coronavirus family
the estimated mortality of corona virus is 3-4%
the novel coronavirus has an incubation period of 2-14 days
we will defeat the corona virus covid-19 ncov
asprin nasal spray not a cure
cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter 3 feet from people who are coughing or sneezing
